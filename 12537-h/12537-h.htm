<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The observations which form the basis of the following letters,
were collected during three successive tours in Normandy, in the
summers of 1815, 1818, and 1819; but chiefly in the second of these
years. Where I have not depended upon my own remarks, I have
endeavored, as far as appeared practicable and without tedious
minuteness, to quote my authorities for facts; and I believe that I
have done so in most instances, except indeed where I have borrowed
from the journals of the companions of my tours,&#8212;the nearest
and dearest of my connections,&#8212;or from that of my friend, Mr.
Cohen, who, at almost the same time, travelled through a great part
of Normandy, pursuing also very similar objects of inquiry. The
materials obtained from these sources, it has been impossible to
separate from my own; and, interwoven as they are with the rest of
the text, it is only in my power to acknowledge, in these general
terms, the assistance which I have thus received.&#8212;We were
proceeding in 1818, to the southern and western districts of
Normandy, when a domestic calamity compelled me to return to
England. The tour was consequently abridged, and many places of
note remained unvisited by us.</p>
<p>My narrative is principally addressed to those readers who find
pleasure in the investigation of architectural antiquity. Without
the slightest pretensions to the character either of an architect
or of an antiquarian, engaged in other avocations and employed in
other studies, I am but too conscious of my inability to do justice
to the subject. Yet my remarks may at least assist the future
traveller, by pointing out such objects as are interesting, either
on account of their antiquity or their architectural worth. This
information is not to be obtained from the French, who have
habitually neglected the investigation of their national monuments.
I doubt, however, whether I should have ventured upon publication,
if those who have always accompanied me both at home and abroad,
had not produced the illustrations which constitute the principal
value of my volumes. Of the merits of these illustrations I must
not be allowed to speak; but it may be permitted me to observe,
that the fine arts afford the only mode of exerting the talents of
woman, which does not violate the spirit of the precept which the
greatest historian of antiquity has ascribed to the greatest of her
heroes&#8212;</p>

<h4>ARRIVAL AT DIEPPE&#8212;SITUATION AND APPEARANCE OF THE
TOWN&#8212;COSTUME OF THE PEOPLE&#8212;INHABITANTS OF THE SUBURB OF
POLLET.</h4>
<p class="r">(<i>Dieppe, June</i>, 1818)</p>
<p>MY DEAR SIR,</p>
<p>You, who were never at sea, can scarcely imagine the pleasure we
felt, when, after a passage of unusual length, cooped up with
twenty-four other persons in a packet designed only for twelve, and
after having experienced every variety that could he afforded by a
dead calm, a contrary wind, a brisk gale in our favor, and,
finally, by being obliged to lie three hours in a heavy swell off
this port, we at last received on board our French pilot, and saw
hoisted on the pier the white flag, the signal of ten feet water in
the harbor. The general appearance of the coast, near Dieppe, is
similar to that which we left at Brighton; but the height of the
cliffs, if I am not mistaken, is greater. They vary along the
shores of Upper Normandy from one hundred and fifty <a name=
"Page_2" id="Page_2"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;2]</span></a>to seven hundred feet, or even
more; the highest lying nearly mid-way between this town and Havre,
in the vicinity of F&#233;camp; and they present an unbroken
barrier, of a dazzling white<a name="FNanchor1" id=
"FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, except
when they dip into some creek or cove, or open to afford a passage
to some river or streamlet. Into one of these, a boat from the
opposite shores of Sussex shot past us this afternoon, with the
rapidity of lightning. She was a smuggler, and, in spite of the
army of Douaniers employed in France, ventured to make the land in
the broad face of day, carrying most probably a cargo, composed
principally of manufactured goods in cotton and steel. The crew of
our vessel, no bad authority in such cases, assured us, that lace
is also sent in considerable quantities as a contraband article
into France; though, as is well known, much of it likewise comes in
the same quality into England, and there are perhaps few of our
travellers, who return entirely without it. On the same authority,
I am enabled to state, what much surprised me, that the smuggled
goods exported from Sussex into Normandy exceed by nearly an
hundred fold those received in return.</p>
<p>The first approach to Dieppe is extremely striking. To embark in
the evening at Brighton, sleep soundly in the packet, and find
yourself, as is commonly the case, early the next morning under the
piers of this town, is a transition, <a name="Page_3" id=
"Page_3"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;3]</span></a>which, to a
person unused to foreign countries, can scarcely fail to appear
otherwise than as a dream; so marked and so entire is the
difference between the air of elegance and mutual resemblance in
the buildings, of smartness approaching to splendor in the
equipages, of fashion in the costume, of the activity of commerce
in the movements, and of newness and neatness in every part of the
one, contrasted in the other with a strong character of poverty and
neglect, with houses as various in their structure as in their
materials, with dresses equally dissimilar in point of color,
substance, and style, with carriages which seem never to have known
the spirit of improvement, and with a general listlessness of
manner, the result of indolence, apathy, and want of occupation.
With all this, however, the novelty which attends the entrance of
the harbor at Dieppe, is not only striking, but interesting. It is
not thus at Calais, where half the individuals you meet in the
streets are of your own country; where English fashions and
manufactures are commonly adopted; and where you hear your native
tongue, not only in the hotels, but even the very beggars follow
you with, "I say, give me un sou, s'il vous please." But this is
not the only advantage which the road by Dieppe from London to
Paris possesses, over that by Calais. There is a saving of
distance, amounting to twenty miles on the English, and sixty on
the French side of the water; the expence is still farther
decreased by the yet lower rate of charges at the inns; and, while
the ride to the French metropolis by the one route is through a
most uninteresting country, with no other objects of curiosity than
Amiens, Beauvais, and Abbeville; by the other it passes <a name=
"Page_4" id="Page_4"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;4]</span></a>through a province unrivalled for
its fertility and for the beauty of its landscape, and which is
allowed by the French themselves to be the garden of the kingdom.
Rouen, Vernon, Mantes, and St. Germain, names all more or less
connected with English history, successively present themselves to
the traveller; and, during the greater part of his journey, his
path lies by the side of a noble stream, diversified beyond almost
every other by the windings of its channel, and the islands which
stud its surface. The only evil to counterbalance the claims of
Dieppe is, that the packets do not sail daily, although they
profess and actually advertise to that effect; but wait till what
they consider a sufficient freight of passengers is assembled, so
that, either at Dieppe or Brighton, a person runs the risk of being
detained, as has more than once happened to myself, a circumstance
that never occurs at Dover. There is still a third point of passage
upon our southern coast, and one that has of late been considerably
frequented, from Southampton to Havre; but this I never tried, and
do not know what it has to recommend it, except to those who are
proceeding to Caen or to the western parts of France. The voyage is
longer and more uncertain, the distance by land between London and
Paris is also greater, nor does it offer equal facilities as to
inns and public carriages.</p>
<p>Dieppe is situated on a low tongue of land, but from the sea
appears to great advantage; characterized as it is by its old
castle, an assemblage of various forms and ages, placed insulated
upon an eminence to the west, and by the domes and towers of its
churches. The mouth of the harbor is narrow, and inclosed by two
long stone <a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;5]</span></a>piers, on one of which stands an
elegant crucifix, raised by the fathers of the mission; to the
other has lately been affixed a stone, with an inscription, stating
that the Duchess d'Angoul&#234;me landed there on her return to her
native country; but here is no measure of her foot, no votive
pillar, as are to be seen at Calais, to commemorate a similar honor
done to the inhabitants by the monarch. A small house on the
western pier, is, however, more deserving of notice than either the
inscription or the crucifix: it was built by Louis XVIth, for the
residence of a sailor, who, by saving the lives of shipwrecked
mariners, had deserved well of his sovereign and his country. Its
front bears, "A J'n. A'r. Bouzard, pour ses services maritimes;"
but there was originally a second inscription in honor of the king,
which has been carefully erased. The fury of the revolution could
pardon nothing that bore the least relation to royalty; or surely a
monument like this, the reward of courage and calculated to inspire
only the best of feelings<a name="FNanchor2" id=
"FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, might
have been allowed to have remained uninjured. The French are wiser
than we are in erecting these public memorials for public virtues:
they better understand the art of producing an effect, and they
know that such gratifications bestowed upon the living are seldom
thrown away. We rarely give them but to the dead. Capt. Manby, to
whom above one hundred and thirty shipwrecked mariners are even now
indebted for their existence, and whose invention will probably be
the means of preservation to thousands, is allowed to live in
comparative <a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;6]</span></a>obscurity; while in France, a
mere pilot, for having saved the lives of only eight individuals,
had a residence built for him at the public expence, received an
immediate gratification of one thousand francs, enjoyed a pension
during his life, and, with his name and his exploits, now occupies
a conspicuous place in the history of the duchy.</p>
<p>Within the piers, the harbor widens into a stone basin, capable
of holding two hundred vessels, and full of water at the flow of
the tide; but at the ebb exhibiting little more than a sheet of
mud, with a small stream meandering through it. Round the harbor is
built the town, which contains above twenty thousand inhabitants,
and is singularly picturesque, as well from its situation, backed
as it is by the steep cliff to the east, which, instead of
terminating here abruptly, takes an inland direction, as from the
diversity in the forms and materials of the houses of the quay,
some of which are of stone, others of grey flint, more of plaster
with their timbers uncovered and painted of different colors, but
most of brick, not uncommonly ornamented, with roofs as steep as
those of the Thuilleries, and full of projecting lucarnes. This
remark, however, applies only to the quay: in its streets, Dieppe
is conspicuous among French towns for the uniformity of its
buildings. After the bombardment in 1694, when the English, foiled
near Brest, wreaked their vengeance upon Dieppe, and reduced the
whole to ashes, the town was rebuilt on a regular plan, agreeably
to a royal ordinance. Hence this is commonly regarded as one of the
handsomest places in France, and you will find it mentioned as such
by most authors; but the unfortunate architect who was employed in
rebuilding it, got no other reward <a name="Page_7" id=
"Page_7"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;7]</span></a>than general
complaints and the nickname of M. G&#226;teville. The
inconveniences arising from the arrangements of the houses which he
erected must have been serious; for we find that sixty years
afterwards an order of council was procured, allowing the
inhabitants to make some alterations that they considered most
essential to their comfort. Upon the quay there is occasionally
somewhat of the activity of commerce; but elsewhere it is as I have
observed before, as well with the people as the buildings. As far
as the houses are concerned, a little care and paint would remove
their squalid aspect: to an English eye it is singularly offensive;
but it cannot possibly be so to the French, among whom it seems
almost universal.</p>
<p>To a painter Dieppe must be a source of great delight: the
situation, the buildings, the people offer an endless variety; but
nothing is more remarkable than the costume of the females of the
middle and lower classes, most of whom wear high pyramidal caps,
with long lappets entirely concealing their hair, red, blue, or
black corsets, large wooden shoes, black stockings, and full
scarlet petticoats of the coarsest woollen, pockets of some
different die attached to the outside, and not uncommonly the
appendage of a key or corkscrew: occasionally too the color of
their costume is still farther diversified by a chequered
handkerchief and white apron. The young are generally pretty; the
old, tanned and ugly; and the transition from youth to age seems
instantaneous: labor and poverty have destroyed every intermediate
gradation; but, whether young or old, they have all the same
good-humored look, and appear generally industrious, though almost
incessantly talking. Even on Sundays or <a name="Page_8" id=
"Page_8"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;8]</span></a>feast-days,
bonnets are seldom to be seen, but round their necks are suspended
large silver or gilt ornaments, usually crosses, while long gold
ear-rings drop from either side of their head, and their shoes
frequently glitter with paste buckles of an enormous size. Such is
the present costume of the females at Dieppe, and throughout the
whole Pays de Caux; and in this description, the lover of
antiquarian research will easily trace a resemblance to the attire
of the women of England, in the XVth and XVIth centuries. As to the
cap, which the Cauchoise wears when she appears <i>en grand
costume</i>, its very prototype is to be found in <i>Strutt's
Ancient Dresses</i>. Decorated with silver before, and with lace
streaming behind, it towers on the head of the stiff-necked
complacent wearer, whose locks appear beneath, arrayed with
statuary precision. Nor is its antiquity solely confined to its
form and fashion; for, descending from the great grandmother to the
great grand-daughter, it remains as an heir-loom in the family from
generation unto generation. In my former visit to Normandy, three
years ago, we first saw this head-dress at the theatre at Rouen,
and my companion was so struck with it that he made the sketch, of
which I send you a copy. The costume of the females of somewhat
higher rank is very becoming: they wear muslin caps, opening in
front to shew their graceful ringlets, colored gowns, scarlet
handkerchiefs, and black aprons.</p>

"Head-Dress of Women of the Pays de Caux" /></p>
<p>But nothing connected with the costume or manners of the people
at Dieppe is equally interesting as what refers to the inhabitants
of the suburb called Pollet; and I will therefore conclude my
letter, by extracting from <a name="Page_9" id=
"Page_9"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;9]</span></a>the
historian of the place<a name="FNanchor3" id=
"FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> his
account of these men, which, though written many years ago, is true
in the main even in our days, and it is to be hoped will, in its
most important respects, continue so for a length of time to come.
"Three-fourths of the natives of this part of the town are
fishermen, and not less effectually distinguished from the citizens
of Dieppe by their name of Poltese, taken from their place of
residence, than by the difference in their dress and language, the
simplicity of their manners, and the narrow extent of their
acquirements. To the present hour they continue to preserve the
same costume as in the XVIth century; wearing trowsers covered with
wide short petticoats, which open in the middle to afford room for
the legs to move, and woollen waistcoats laced in the front with
ribands, and tucked below into the waistband of their trowsers.
Over these waistcoats is a close coat, without buttons or
fastenings of any kind, which falls so low as to hide their
petticoats and extend a foot or more beyond them. These articles of
apparel are usually of cloth or serge of a uniform color, and
either red or blue; for they interdict every other variation,
except that all the seams of their dress are faced with white silk
galloon, full an inch in width. To complete the whole, instead of
hats, they have on their heads caps of velvet or colored cloth,
forming a <i>tout-ensemble</i> of attire, which is evidently
ancient, but far from unpicturesque or displeasing. Thus clad, the
Poltese, though in the midst of the kingdom, have the appearance of
a distinct and foreign colony; whilst, occupied incessantly in
fishing, they have remained equally <a name="Page_10" id=
"Page_10"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;10]</span></a>strangers
to the civilization and politeness, which the progress of letters
during the last two centuries has diffused over France. Nay,
scarcely are they acquainted with four hundred words of the French
language; and these they pronounce with an idiom exclusively their
own, adding to each an oath, by way of epithet; a habit so
inveterate with them, that even at confession, at the moment of
seeking absolution for the practice, it is no uncommon thing with
them to <i>swear</i> they will be guilty of it no more. To balance,
however, this defect, their morals are uncorrupted, their fidelity
is exemplary, and they are laborious and charitable, and zealous
for the honor of their country, in whose cause they often bleed, as
well as for their priests, in defence of whom they once threatened
to throw the Archbishop of Rouen into the river, and were well nigh
executing their threats."</p>

<h2>LETTER II.</h2>
<h4>DIEPPE&#8212;CASTLE&#8212;CHURCHES&#8212;HISTORY OF THE
PLACE&#8212;FEAST OF THE ASSUMPTION.</h4>
<p class="r">(<i>Dieppe, June</i>, 1818.)</p>
<p>The bombardment of this town, alluded to in my last, was so
effectual in its operation, that, excepting the castle and the two
churches, the place can boast of little to arrest the attention of
the antiquary, or of the curious traveller. These three objects
were indeed almost all that escaped the conflagration; and for this
they were indebted to their insulated situations, the first on an
eminence unconnected with the houses of the place, the other two in
their respective cemeteries.</p>
<p>The hill on which the castle stands is steep; and the building,
as well from its position, as from its high walls, flanked with
towers and bastions, has an imposing appearance. In its general
outline it bears a resemblance to the castle of Stirling, but it
has not the same claims to attention in an architectural point of
view. It is a confused mass of various &#230;ras, and its parts are
chiefly modern: nor is there any single feature that deserves to be
particularized for beauty or singularity; yet, as a whole, a
picturesque and pleasing effect results from the very confusion and
irregularity of its towers, roofs, and turrets; and this is also
enhanced by a row of lofty arches, thrown across a ravine near the
entrance, supporting the bridge, and appearing at a distance like
the <a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;12]</span></a>remains of a Roman aqueduct.
What seems to be the most ancient part is a high quadrangular tower
with lofty pointed pannels in the four walls; and though inferior
in antiquity, an observer accustomed only to the English
castellated style, is struck by the variety of numerous circular
towers with conical roofs, resembling those which flanked the gates
of the town. Some of these gates still remain perfect; and one of
them, leading to the sea, now serves as a military prison. It was
the Sieur des Mar&#234;ts<a name="FNanchor4" id=
"FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, the first
governor of the place, who began this castle shortly after the year
1443, when Louis the XIth, then dauphin, freed Dieppe from the
dominion of the English, attacking in person, and carrying by
assault, the formidable fortress, constructed by Talbot, in the
suburb of Pollet. Of this, not a vestige now remains: the whole was
levelled with the ground in 1689; though, at a period of one
hundred and twenty years after it was originally taken and
dismantled, it had again been made a place of strength by the
Huguenots, and had been still further fortified under Henry IVth,
in whose reign the present castle was completed; for it was not
till this time that permission was given to the inhabitants to add
to it a keep. In its perfect state, whilst defended by this keep,
and still further protected by copious out-works and bomb-proof
casemates, its strength was great; but the period of its power was
of short duration; for the then perturbed state of France naturally
gave rise to anxiety on the part of the government, lest fortresses
should serve as rallying points to the faction of the league; and
the castle of Dieppe was consequently <a name="Page_13" id=
"Page_13"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;13]</span></a>left with
little more than the semblance of its former greatness.</p>
<p>Of the churches here, that of St. Jaques is considerably the
finest building, and is indeed an excellent specimen of what has
been called the <i>decorated English style of architecture</i>, the
style of this church nearly coinciding in its principal lines with
that which prevailed in our own country during the reigns of the
second and third Edward. It was begun about the year 1260, but was
little advanced at the commencement of the following century; nor
were its nineteen chapels, the works of the piety of individuals,
completed before 1350. The roof of the choir remained imperfect
till ninety years afterwards, whilst that of the transept is as
recent as 1628<a name="FNanchor5" id="FNanchor5"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. The most ancient work is
discernible in the transepts, but the lines are obscured by later
additions. A cloister gallery fronted by delicate mullions runs
round the nave and choir, and the extent and arrangement of the
exterior would induce a stranger, unacquainted with the history of
the building, to suppose that he was entering a conventual or
cathedral church. The parts long most generally admired by the
French, though they have always been miserable judges of gothic
architecture, were the vaulted roof, and the pendants of the
Lady-Chapel. The latter were originally ornamented with female
figures, representing the Sibyls, made of colored terra cotta, and
of such excellent workmanship, that Cardinal Barberini, when he
visited this chapel in 1647, declared he had seen nothing of the
kind, not even in Italy, superior to them for the beauty and
delicacy of their execution; <a name="Page_14" id=
"Page_14"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;14]</span></a>but they
are now gone, and, according to Noel<a name="FNanchor6" id=
"FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, were
destroyed at the time of the bombardment. The state, however, of
the roof does not seem to warrant this observation; and, contrary
also to what he says, the pendants between the Lady-Chapel and the
choir are still perfect, and serve, together with numerous small
canopies in the chapel itself, to give a clear idea of what the
whole must have been originally. One of the most elegant of the
decorations of the church is a spirally-twisted column, elaborately
carved, with a peculiarly fanciful and beautiful capital, placed
against a pillar that separates the two south-eastern chapels of
the choir. The richest object is a stone-screen to a chantry on the
north side, which is divide into several canopies, whose upper part
is still full of a profusion of sculpture, though the lower is
sadly mutilated. I could not ascertain its history or use; but I do
not suppose it is of earlier date than the age of Francis Ist, as
the Roman or Italian style is blended with the Gothic arch. The
Chapel of the Sepulchre, is not uncommonly pointed out as an object
of admiration. There is certainly some, handsome sculpture round
the portal; but it is not this for which your admiration is
required: you are told that the chapel was made in 1612, at the
expence of a traveller, then just returned from Palestine, and that
it offers a faithful representation of the Holy Sepulchre itself at
Jerusalem; by which if we are to understand that the wretched,
grisly, painted, wooden figures of the three Maries, and other holy
women and holy men, assembled round a disgusting representation of
the dead Saviour, have their prototype in Judea, I can only add I
am sorry <a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;15]</span></a>for it: for my own part, putting
aside all question of the propriety or effect of symbolical
worship, and meaning nothing offensive to the Romish faith, I must
be allowed to say that most assuredly I can conceive nothing less
qualified to excite feelings of devotion, or more certain to awaken
contempt and loathing, than the images of this description, the
tinselled virgins, and the wretched daubs, nick-named paintings,
which abound in the churches of Picardy and Normandy, the only
catholic provinces which I have yet visited; so that, if the taste
of the inhabitants is to be estimated by the decoration of the
religious buildings, this faculty must be rated very low indeed.
The exterior of the church is as richly ornamented as the inside;
and not a buttress, arch, or canopy is without the remains of
crumbled carving, worn by time, or disfigured by the ruder hand of
calvinistic or revolutionary violence. Tradition refers the
erection of this edifice to the English. From the certainty with
which a date may be assigned to almost every part, it is very
interesting to the lover of architecture. The Lady-Chapel is also
perhaps one of the last specimens of Gothic art, but still very
pure, except in some of the smaller ornaments, such, as the niches
in the tabernacles, which end in escalop shells.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_03" id="plate_03"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_03.png" height="311" width="205" alt=
"Font in the Church of St. Remi, at Dieppe" /></p>
<p>The other church is dedicated to St. Remi, and is a building of
the XVIIth century; though, judging from some of its pillars, it
would be pronounced considerably more ancient. Those of the
transept and of the central tower are lofty and clustered, and of
extraordinary thickness; the rest are circular and plain, and not
very unlike the columns of our earliest Norman or Saxon churches,
though of greater proportionate altitude. The capitals of those in
the choir are singularly capricious, with figures, <a name=
"Page_16" id="Page_16"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;16]</span></a> scrolls, &amp;c.; but it is the
capriciousness of the gothic verging into Grecian, not of the
Norman. On the pendants of the nave are painted various ornaments,
each accompanied by a mitre. The eastern has only a mitre and
cross, with the date 1669; the western the same, with 1666;
denoting the &#230;ra of the edifice, which was scarcely finished,
when a bomb, in 1694, destroyed the roof of the choir, and this
remains to the present hour incomplete. The most remarkable object
in the church is a <i>b&#233;nitier</i> of coarse red granite, on
whose basin is an inscription, to me illegible. The annexed
sketches will give you some idea of it:</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_01" id="picture_01"></a><br />
<img src="images/picture_01.png" height="150" width="355" alt=
"Inscription" /></p>
<p>In the letters one looks naturally for a date: the figures that
alternate with them are probably mitres, and, like those on the
roof, indicate the supreme jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Rouen
in the place.</p>
<p>Dieppe itself is, by its own historians<a name="FNanchor7" id=
"FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, said to
boast an origin as early as the days of Charlemagne<a name=
"FNanchor8" id="FNanchor8"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, who <a name="Page_17" id=
"Page_17"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;17]</span></a>is
reported to have built a fortress on the scite of the present town,
and to have called it Bertheville, in honor of the Berthas, his
mother and his daughter. Bertheville was one of the first places
taken by the Normans, by whom the appellation was changed to Dyppe
or Dieppe, a word which in their language is said to signify a good
anchorage. Other writers<a name="FNanchor9" id=
"FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, however,
treat the whole of the early chronicle of Dieppe as a fiction, and
maintain, that even at the beginning of the XIth century the town
had no existence, and the place was only known as the port of
Arques, within whose territory it was comprehended; nor was it till
the end of the same century that the inhabitants of Arques were,
partly from the convenience of the fisheries, and partly from the
advantages of the salt trade, induced to form this settlement.
Whatever date may be assigned to the foundation of Dieppe, it is
frequently contended that William the Conqueror embarked here for
the invasion of England, and it seems undoubted that he sailed
hence for his new kingdom in the next year, agreeably to the
following passage from Ordericus Vitalis, (p. 509) by which you
will observe, that the river had at that time the same name as the
town, "Deinde sext&#226; nocte Decembris ad ostium amnis Depp&#230;
ultra oppidtim Archas accessit, prim&#226;que vigili&#226;
gelid&#230; noctis Austro vela dedit, et mane portum oppositi
littoris, (quem Vvicenesium vocitant) prospero cursu arripuit." In
1188, our Henry II built a castle upon the same hill on which the
present fortress stands. This strong hold, however, afforded little
protection; for we find that, in 1195, Philip Augustus of France,
entering Normandy with an hostile army, laid siege to Dieppe, and
set fire <a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;18]</span></a>not only to the town, but also
to the shipping in the harbor. Two years subsequently to this
event, Dieppe ceased to form a part of the demesne of the Sovereign
of the Duchy. Richard the Ist had given great offence to Walter,
Archbishop of Rouen, by persisting in the erection of Ch&#226;teau
Gaillard, in the vicinity of Andelys, which belonged to the
archbishop in right of his see; and though our lion-hearted monarch
was not appalled either by the papal interdict or by the showers of
blood that fell upon his workmen, yet at length he thought it
advisable to purchase at once the forgiveness of the prelate and
the secular seignory of Andelys, by surrendering to him, as an
equivalent, the towns and lordships of Dieppe and Louviers, the
land and forest of Alihermont, the land and lordship of Bouteilles,
and the mills of Rouen. This exchange was regarded as so great a
subject of triumph to the archbishop, that he caused the memory of
it to be perpetuated by inscriptions upon crosses in various parts
of Rouen, some of which remained as late as 1610, when Taillepied
wrote his <i>Recueil des Antiquit&#233;z et Singularit&#233;z de la
Ville de Rouen</i>. The following lines are given as one of these
inscriptions in the <i>Gallia Christiana</i><a name="FNanchor10"
id="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i3">"Vicisti, Galtere, tui sunt signa triumphi</p>
<p class="i1">Deppa, Locoveris, Alacris-mons, Butila, molta,</p>
<p class="i1">Deppa maris portus, Alacris-mons locus
am&#339;nus,</p>
<p class="i1">Villa Locoveris, rus Butila, molta per urbem.</p>
<p class="i1">Hactenus h&#230;c Regis Richardi jura fuere;</p>

</div>
</div>
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;19]</span></a>
<p>Nor was this the only memorial of the fact; for the advantages
of the exchange were so generally recognized, that the name of
Walter became proverbial; and to this day it is said in Normandy of
a man who over-reaches another, "c'est un fin Gautier." It might be
inferred from the terms of the bargain in which Dieppe merely
appears as one of the items of the account, that it was then a
place of little consequence; yet, one of the old chroniclers speaks
of it at the time it was taken by the French under Philip Augustus,
as</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i5">"portus fam&#226; celeberrimus atque</p>
<p class="i1">Villa potens opibus."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These historians, however, of former days are not always the
most accurate; but from this period the annals of the place are
preserved, and at certain epochs it is far from unimportant in
French history: as, when Talbot <a name="Page_20" id=
"Page_20"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;20]</span></a>raised in
1442 the fortress called the Bastille, a defence so strong and in
so well-chosen a situation, that even Vauban honored its memory by
lamenting its destruction; when the inhabitants fought with the
Flemings in the channel, in 1555; when Henry IVth, with an army of
less than four thousand men, fled hither in 1589, as to his last
place of refuge, winning the hearts of the people by his frank
address:&#8212;"Mes amis, point de c&#233;r&#233;monie, je ne
demande que vos c&#339;urs, bon pain, bon vin, et bon visage
d'h&#244;tes;" and when, as I have already mentioned, the town
sustained from our fleet a bombardment of three days' duration, and
was reduced by it to ashes.</p>
<p>For the excellence of its sailors, Dieppe has at all times been
renowned: no less an authority than the President de Thou has
pronounced them to be men, "penes quos pr&#230;cipua rei
nautic&#230; gloria semper fuit;" and they have proved their claims
to this encomium, not only by having supplied to the navy of France
the celebrated Abraham Du Quesne, the successful rival of the great
Ruyter, but still more so by having taken the lead in expeditions
to Florida<a name="FNanchor12" id="FNanchor12"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>; by having established a colony
for the promotion of the fur trade in Canada, if indeed they were
not the original discoverers of that country; and by having been
the first Christians who ever made a settlement on the coast of
Senegal. This last-mentioned event took place, according to French
writers, at as early a period as the XIVth century; and, though the
establishment was not of long duration, its effects have been
permanent; <a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;21]</span></a>for it is owing to the
consignments of ivory then made to Dieppe, that many of the
inhabitants were induced to become workers in that substance; a
trade which they preserve to the present time, and carry the art to
such perfection that they have few rivals. This and the making of
lace are the principal employments of such of the natives as are
not engaged in the fishery. In the earlier ages of the Duchy, the
inhabitants of the Pays de Caux found a more effectual and
important employment in the salt-works which were then very
numerous on the coast, but which have long since been suffered to
fall into decay. Ancient charters, recorded in the <i>Neustria
Pia</i>, trace these works on the coast of Dieppe, and at
Bouteilles on the right of the valley of Arques, to as remote a
period as 1027; and they at the same time prove the existence of a
canal between Dieppe and Bouteilles, by which in 1390 vessels
loaded with salt were wont to pass. But here, as in England, such
works have been abandoned, from the greater facility of
communication between distant places, and of obtaining salt by
other means.</p>
<p>At present the only manufacture on the beach is that of kelp,
for which a large quantity of the coarser sea-weeds is burned; but
the fisheries, which are not carried on with equal energy in any
other port of France, are the chief support of the place. The
sailors of Dieppe were not confined to their own seas; for they
used to pursue the cod fishery on the coast of Newfoundland with
considerable success. The herring fishery however was a greater
staple; and previously to the revolution, when alone a just
estimate could be formed of such matters, the quantity of herrings
caught by the boats belonging to <a name="Page_22" id=
"Page_22"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;22]</span></a>Dieppe
averaged more than eight thousand lasts a year, and realized above
&#163;100,000. This fishery is said to have been established here
as early as the XIth century<a name="FNanchor13" id=
"FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>. From
sixty to eighty boats, each of about thirty tons and carrying
fifteen men, were annually sent to the eastern coast of England
about the end of August; and then, again, in the middle of October
nearly double the quantity of vessels, but of a smaller size, were
engaged in the same pursuit on their own shores, where the fish by
this time repair. The mackerel fishery was an object of scarcely
less importance than that of herrings, producing in general about
one hundred and seventy thousand barrels annually. Great quantities
of these fish are eaten salted and dried, in which state they
afford a general article of food among the lower classes in
Normandy. Surely this would be deserving of the attention and
imitation of our merchants at home. During the war with England
this branch of trade necessarily suffered; but Napol&#233;on did
every thing in his power to assist the town, by giving it peculiar
advantages as to ships sailing under licences. He succeeded in his
views; and, thus patronized, Dieppe flourished exceedingly, and the
gains brought in by the privateers connected with the port, added
not a little to its prosperity. Hence to this hour the inhabitants
regret the peace, although the town cannot fail to be benefitted by
the fresh impulse given to the fisheries, and the quantity of money
circulated by the travellers who are continually passing.
Napol&#233;on intended also to bestow an additional boon upon the
place. A canal had been projected many years ago, in the time of
the Mar&#233;chal de Vauban, and <a name="Page_23" id=
"Page_23"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;23]</span></a>was to
have extended to Pontoise, through the fertile districts of Gournay
and Neufch&#226;tel, and to have communicated by different branches
with the Seine and Oise. This plan, which had been forgotten during
so many reigns, Napol&#233;on determined to carry into effect, and
the excavations were actually begun under his orders. But the
events which succeeded his Russian campaign put a stop to this, as
to all similar labors: the plan is now, however, again in
agitation, and, if performed, Dieppe will soon become one of the
most important ports in France.</p>
<p>By the revolution Dieppe was emancipated from the dominion of
the Archbishop of Rouen, who, by virtue of the cession made by
Richard C&#339;ur de Lion, exercised a despotic sway, even until
the dissolution of the <i>ancien r&#233;gime</i>. His privileges
were oppressive, and he had and made use of the right of imposing a
variety of taxes, which extended even to the articles of provision
imported either by land or sea. Yet it must be admitted that the
progress of civilization had previously done much towards the
removal of the most obnoxious of the abuses. The times, happily, no
longer existed, when, as in the XIIth century, the prelate, with a
degree of indecency scarcely to be credited, especially under an
ecclesiastical government, did not scruple to convert the wages of
sin into a source of revenue, as scandalous in its nature as it
must have been contemptible in its amount, by exacting from every
prostitute a weekly tax of a farthing, for liberty to exercise her
profession<a name="FNanchor14" id="FNanchor14"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Many uncouth and frivolous ecclesiastical rites and ceremonies
of the middle ages, which good sense had <a name="Page_24" id=
"Page_24"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;24]</span></a>banished
from most other parts of France, where they once were common, still
lingered in the archbishop's seignory. Thus, at no very remote
period, it was customary on the Feast of Pentecost to cast burning
flakes of tow from the vaulting of the church; this stage-trick
being considered as a representation of the descent of the fiery
tongues. The Virgin, the great idol of popery, was honored by a
pageant, which was celebrated with extraordinary splendor; and as I
must initiate you in the mysteries of Catholicism, I think you will
be well pleased to receive a detailed account of it. The ceremony I
consider as curiously illustrative of the manners of the rulers, of
the ruled, and of the times; and I will only add, by way of
preface, that it was instituted by the governor, Des Mar&#234;ts,
in 1443, in honor of the final expulsion of the English, and that
he himself consented to be the first master of the <i>Guild of the
Assumption</i>, under whose auspices and direction it was
conducted.&#8212;About Midsummer the principal inhabitants used to
assemble at the H&#244;tel de Ville, and there they selected the
girl of the most exemplary character, to represent the Virgin Mary,
and with her six other young women, to act the parts of the
Daughters of Sion. The honor of figuring in this holy drama was
greatly coveted; and the historian of Dieppe gravely assures us,
that the earnestness felt on the occasion mainly contributed to the
preservation of that purity of manners and that genuine piety,
which subsisted in this town longer than in any other of France!
But the election of the Virgin was not sufficient: a representative
of St. Peter was also to be found among the clergy; and the laity
were so far favored that they were permitted to <a name="Page_25"
id="Page_25"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;25]</span></a>furnish
the eleven other apostles. This done, upon the fourteenth of August
the Virgin was laid in a cradle of the form of a tomb, and was
carried early in the morning, attended by her suite of either sex,
to the church of St. Jacques; while before the door of the master
of the guild was stretched a large carpet, embroidered with verses
in letters of gold, setting forth his own good qualities, and his
love for the holy Mary. Hither also, as soon as <i>Laudes</i> had
been sung, the procession repaired from the church, and then they
were joined by the governor of the town, the members of the guild,
the municipal officers, and the clergy of the parish of St. Remi.
Thus attended, they paraded the town, singing hymns, which were
accompanied by a full band. The procession was increased by the
great body of the inhabitants; and its impressiveness was still
farther augmented by numbers of the youth of either sex, who
assumed the garb and attributes of their patron saints, and mixed
in the immediate train of the principal actors. They then again
repaired to the church, where <i>Te Deum</i> was sung by the full
choir, in commemoration of the victory over the English, and high
mass was performed, and the Sacrament administered to the whole
party. During the service, a scenic representation was given of the
Assumption of the Virgin. A scaffolding was raised, reaching nearly
to the top of the dome, and supporting an azure canopy intended to
emulate the "spangled vault of heaven;" and about two feet below
the summit of it appeared, seated on a splendid throne, an old man
as the image of the Father Almighty, a representation equally
absurd and impious, and which could alone be tolerated by the
votaries of the <a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;26]</span></a>worst superstitions of popery.
On either side four pasteboard angels of the size of men floated in
the air, and flapped their wings in cadence to the sounds of the
organ; while above was suspended a large triangle, at whose corners
were placed three smaller angels, who, at the intermission of each
office, performed upon a set of little bells the hymn of "<i>Ave
Maria grati&#226; Dei plena per Secula</i>," &amp;c. accompanied by
a larger angel on each side with a trumpet. To complete this
portion of the spectacle, two others, below the old man's feet,
held tapers, which were lighted as the services began, and
extinguished at their close; on which occasions the figures were
made to express reluctance by turning quickly about; so that it
required some dexterity to apply the extinguishers. At the
commencement of the mass, two of the angels by the side of the
Almighty descended to the foot of the altar, and, placing
themselves by the tomb, in which a pasteboard figure of the Virgin
had been substituted for her living representative, gently raised
it to the feet of the Father. The image, as it mounted, from time
to time lifted its head and extended its arms, as if conscious of
the approaching beatitude, then, after having received the
benediction and been encircled by another angel with a crown of
glory, it gradually disappeared behind the clouds. At this instant
a buffoon, who all the time had been playing his antics below,
burst into an extravagant fit of joy; at one moment clapping his
hands most violently, at the next stretching himself out as if
dead. Finally, he ran up to the feet of the old man, and hid
himself under his legs, so as to shew only his head. The people
called him <i>Grimaldi</i>, an appellation that appears to have
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;27]</span></a>belonged to him by usage, and it
is a singular coincidence that the surname of the noblest family of
Genoa the Proud, thus assigned by the rude rabble of a sea-port to
their buffoon, should belong of right to the sire and son, whose
<i>mops</i> and <i>mowes</i> afford pastime to the upper gallery at
Covent-Garden.</p>
<p>Thus did the pageant proceed in all its grotesque glory, and,
while&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"These labor'd nothings in so strange a style</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Amazed the unlearned, and made the learned
smile,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>the children shouted aloud for their favorite Grimaldi; the
priests, accompanied with bells, trumpets, and organs, thundered
out the mass; the pious were loud in their exclamations of rapture
at the devotion of the Virgin; and the whole church was filled with
"un non so che di rauco ed indistinto".&#8212;But I have told you
enough of this foolish story, of which it were well if the folly
had been the worst. The sequel was in the same taste and style, and
ended with the euthanasia of all similar representations, a hearty
dinner.</p>

<h2>LETTER III.</h2>
<h4>C&#198;SAR'S CAMP&#8212;CASTLE OF ARQUES.</h4>
<p class="r">(<i>Dieppe, June</i>, 1818)</p>
<p>After having explored Dieppe, I must now conduct you without the
walls, to the castle of Arques and to C&#230;sar's camp, both of
which are in its immediate neighborhood. At some future time you
may thank me for pointing out these objects to you, for should you
ever visit Dieppe, your residence may be prolonged beyond your
wishes, by the usual mischances which attend the traveller. And in
that case, a walk to these relics of military architecture will
furnish a better employment than thumbing the old newspaper of the
inn, or even than the contemplation of the diligences as they come
in, or of the packets as they are not going out, for I am
anticipating that you are becalmed, and that the pennons are
flagging from the mast. With respect to my walk, let me be allowed
to begin by introducing you to a friend of mine at Dieppe, M.
Gaillon, an obliging, sensible, and well-informed young man, as
well as an ardent botanist, my companion in this walk, and the
source of much of the information I possess respecting these
places. The intrenchment, commonly known by the name of
C&#230;sar's camp, or even more generally in the country by that of
"<i>la Cit&#233; de Limes</i>," and in old writings, of "<i>Civitas
Limarum</i>," is situated upon the brink of the cliff, about two
miles to the east of Dieppe, on the road leading to Eu, and still
preserves in a state of perfection its ancient form and <a name=
"Page_29" id="Page_29"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;29]</span></a>character; though necessarily
reduced in the height of its vallum by the operation of time, and
probably also diminished in its size by the gradual encroachments
of the ocean. Upon its shape, which is an irregular triangle, it
may be well to make a preliminary observation, that this was
necessarily prescribed by the scite; and that, however the Romans
might commonly prefer a square outline for their temporary
encampments, we have abundant proofs that they only adhered to this
plan when it was perfectly conformable to the nature of the ground,
but that when they fortified any commanding position, upon which a
rectangular rampart could not be seated, their intrenchments were
made to follow the sinuosities of the hill. In the present instance
the northern side, the longest, extending nearly five thousand
feet, fronts the channel, and it required no other defence than was
afforded by the perpendicular face of the cliff, here more than two
hundred feet in height. The western side, the second in length, and
not greatly inferior to the first, after running about three
thousand feet from the sea, in a tolerably straight line southward,
suddenly bends to the east, and forms two semi-circles, of one of
which the radius is turned from the camp, and of the other into it.
The third side is scarcely more than half the length of the others,
and runs nearly straight from south to north, where it again unites
with the cliff. Of the two last-mentioned sides the first is
difficult of access; from its position at the summit of a steep
hill; but it is still protected by a vallum from thirty to forty
feet high, and between the sea and the entrance nearest to it, a
length of about three hundred yards, by a wide exterior ditch with
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;30]</span></a>other out-works, as well as by
an inner fosse, faint traces of which only now remain. Hence to the
next and large entrance is a distance of about two thousand feet;
and in this space the interior fosse is still very visible; but the
great abruptness of the hill forbade an outer one.</p>
<p>You, who are not a stranger to the pleasures of botany, would
have shared my delight at finding upon the perpendicular side of
this entrance the beautiful <i>Caucalis grandiflora</i>, growing in
great luxuriance upon almost bare chalk, and with its snowy flowers
resembling, as you look down to it, the common species of
<i>Iberis</i> of our gardens. The <i>Asperula cynanchica</i>, and
other plants peculiar to a chalky soil, are also found here in
plenty, together with the <i>Eryngium campestre</i>, a vegetable of
extreme rarity in England, but most abundant throughout the north
of France. <i>Papaver hybridum</i> is likewise common in the
neighboring corn fields round.</p>
<p>Returning from this short botanical digression, let me tell you
that the position considered by some as the southern side of the
fortification, but which I have described as the sinuous part of
the western, has its ramparts of less height. Not so the eastern:
on this, as being the most destitute of all natural defence, (for
here there is no hill, and the eye ranges over an immense level
tract, stopped only by distant woods,) is raised an agger, full
forty-five feet in height, and, at a further distance, is added an
outward trench nearly fifty feet wide, though in its present state
not more than three feet deep, and now serving for a garden.</p>
<p>Such is the external appearance of this camp, which, seen from
the sea, or on the approach either by the west <a name="Page_31"
id="Page_31"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;31]</span></a> or
south, cannot fail to strike from the boldness of its position; but
the effect of the interior is still more striking; for here, while
on one side the horizon is lost in the immensity of the ocean, on
the other two the view is narrowly circumscribed by the lofty
bulwark, at whose feet are almost every where discernible the
remains of the trenches I have already noticed, more than thirty
feet in width. Nor is this the only remarkable circumstance; for it
is still more unaccountable to observe, extending nearly across the
encampment, the traces of an ancient fosse not less than one
hundred and fifty feet wide, and, though in most places shallow,
terminating towards the sea in a deep ravine. Internally the camp
appears to have been also divided into three parts, in one of which
it has been supposed, from a heap of stones which till lately
remained, that there was originally a place of greater strength;
while in another, distinguished by some irregular elevations, it is
conjectured that there was a wall, the defence probably to the
keep.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_04" id="plate_04"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_04.png" height="448" width="600" alt=
"Plan of C&#230;sar's Camp, near Dieppe" /></p>
<p>But I must tell you that these conjectures are none of my own,
nor could I have had any opportunity of making them; the stones and
the hillocks having disappeared before the operations of the
plough. Such as they are, I have borrowed them from a dissertation
by the Abb&#233; de Fontenu<a name="FNanchor15" id=
"FNanchor15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>, a copy
of whose engraving of the place I insert. Indebted as I am to him
for his hints, I can, however, by no means subscribe to his
reasoning, by which he labors with great erudition to prove that,
neither the popular tradition which ascribes this camp to
C&#230;sar, nor its name, evidently Roman, nor some <a name=
"Page_32" id="Page_32"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;32]</span></a>coins and medals of the same
nation that have been found here, are at all evidences of its Latin
origin; but that, as we have no proof that C&#230;sar was ever in
the vicinity of Dieppe, as the whole is in such excellent
preservation, (a point I beg leave to deny,) and as the vallum is
full thrice the height of that of other Roman encampments in
France<a name="FNanchor16" id="FNanchor16"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>, we are bound to infer it is a
work of far more modern times, and probably was erected by Talbot,
the C&#230;sar of the English<a name="FNanchor17" id=
"FNanchor17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>, while
besieging Dieppe in the middle of the XVth century.</p>
<p>This opinion of the learned Abb&#233; I quote, principally for
the purpose of shewing how far a man of sense and <a name="Page_33"
id="Page_33"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;33]</span></a>
acquirements maybe led astray from truth and probability in support
of a favorite theory. Nothing but the love of theory could surely
have induced him to suppose that this strong hold was erected for a
purpose to which it could in no wise be applicable, as the
intervening ground prevents all possibility of seeing any part of
Dieppe from the camp, or to ascribe it to times when earth-works
were no longer used. In Normandy and Picardy are other camps, more
evidently of Roman construction, which are likewise ascribed to
C&#230;sar<a name="FNanchor18" id="FNanchor18"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>; with much the same reason
perhaps as every thing wonderful in Scotland is referred to Fingal,
to King Arthur in Cornwall, and in the north of England and Wales
to the devil.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_05" id="plate_05"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_05.png" height="355" width="600" alt=
"General View of the Castle of Arques" /></p>
<p>Upon the origin of the castle of Arques, it is somewhat
unfortunate for the learned that there is not an equal field for
ingenious conjecture, its antiquity being incontestible. Du Moulin,
the most comprehensive, though the most credulous of Norman
historians, one who, not content with dealing in miracles by
wholesale, tells us how the devil changed himself into a
postillion, to apprize an alehouse-keeper of the fate of the
posterity of Rollo, may still be entitled to credit, when the theme
is merely stone and mortar; and from him we may conclude <a name=
"Page_34" id="Page_34"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;34]</span></a>that Arques was a place of
importance at the time of William the Conqueror, as it gave the
title of Count to his uncle, who then possessed it, and who,
confiding perhaps in the strength of his fortress, and secretly
instigated by Henry Ist, of France, usurped the title of Duke of
Normandy, but was defeated by his nephew, and finally obliged to
surrender his castle. This, however, was not till, after a long
siege, in which Arques proved itself impregnable to every thing but
famine. In the following reign, we again find mention made of
Arques, as a portion given by Robert, Duke of Normandy, to induce
Helie, son of Lambert of St. Saen, to marry his illegitimate
daughter, and join him in defending the Pays de Caux against the
English. From this period, during the reigns of the Anglo-Norman
Sovereigns, it continues to be occasionally noticed. Before the
walls of Arques, according to William of Malmesbury, Baldwin, Count
of Flanders, received the wound which afterwards proved fatal.
Arques was the last castle which held out in Normandy for King
Stephen. It was taken in 1173, by our Henry IInd, and then
repaired; was seized by Philip Augustus during the captivity of
Richard C&#339;ur de Lion; was restored to its legitimate sovereign
at the peace in 1196; and was a source of disgrace to its former
captor, when in 1202 he laid siege to it with a powerful army, and
was obliged to retreat from its walls. Under the reign of our third
Edward, we find it again return to the British crown, as one of the
castles specified to be surrendered to the English, by the treaty
of Bretigny, in 1359; after which, in 1419, it was taken by Talbot
and Warwick, and was finally given up to France by one of <a name=
"Page_35" id="Page_35"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;35]</span></a>the articles of the capitulation
of Rouen in 1449. More recently, in 1584<a name="FNanchor19" id=
"FNanchor19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>, it was
captured by a party of soldiers disguised like sailors, who, being
suffered to approach without distrust, put the sentinels to the
sword, and made themselves masters of the fortress; while in 1589
it obtained its last and most honorable distinction, as the chief
support of Henry IVth, at the time of his being received at Dieppe,
and as having by the cannon from its ramparts, materially
contributed to the glorious defeat of the army of the league,
commanded by the Duke de Mayenne, when thirty thousand were
compelled to retire before one tenth of the number. I have already
mentioned to you the address of this king to the citizens of
Dieppe: still more magnanimous was his speech to his prisoner, the
Count de Belin, previously to this battle, when, on the captive's
daring to ask, how with such a handful of men, he could expect to
resist so powerful an army, "Ajoutez," he answered, "aux troupes
que vous voyez, mon bon droit, et vous ne douterez plus de quel
c&#244;t&#233; sera la victoire."</p>
<p>In <i>Sully's Memoirs</i><a name="FNanchor20" id=
"FNanchor20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>, as
well as in the history of the town of Dieppe, you will find these
transactions described at much length, and the warrior, as well as
the historian, expatiates on the strength of the castle of Arques;
but how much longer it remained a place of <a name="Page_36" id=
"Page_36"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;36]</span></a>consideration I have no means of
knowing: most probably the alteration introduced into the art of
war by the use of cannon, caused it to be soon after neglected, and
dismantled, and suffered to fall gradually into its present state
of ruin. It is now the property of a lady residing in the
neighboring town of Arques, who purchased it during the revolution,
and by her good sense and feeling it has been preserved from
further injury. The castle is situated at the extremity of a ridge
of chalk hills, which, commencing to the west of Dieppe, run nearly
parallel to the sea, and here terminate to the east, so that it has
a complete command over the valley. Standing by its walls, you have
to the north-west a full view of the town of Dieppe; in an opposite
direction the eye ranges uncontrolled over a rich vale of corn and
pasturage; and in front, immediately at your feet, lies the town of
Arques itself, backed by the hills that are covered by the forest
of the same name. Either this forest, or the neighboring one of
Eavy, is supposed to have been the ancient Arelanum. The little
river called the Arques flows through the valley, and beneath the
walls of the castle is lost in the B&#233;thune, under which name
the united waters continue their course to Dieppe, after receiving
the tribute of a third, yet smaller, stream, the Eaulne.</p>
<p>Of the power of the castle an idea may be formed from the extent
of the fosse, little less than half a mile in circumference. The
outline of the walls is irregularly oval, and the even front is
interrupted by towers of various sizes, and placed at unequal
distances. On the northern side, where the hill is steepest, there
are no towers; but the walls are still farther strengthened by
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;37]</span></a> square buttresses, so large
that they indeed look like bastions, and with a projection so great
as to indicate an origin posterior to the Norman &#230;ra. The two
towers which flank the western entrance, and the towers which stand
behind each of the flanking towers in the retiring line of the
wall, are much larger than any of the rest. One of the latter
towers is of so extraordinary a shape, that I consider it as a
non-descript; but, as I should tire both you and myself by
endeavoring to describe it, I think it most prudent to refer you to
a sketch: perhaps its angular parts may not be coeval with the rest
of the building<a name="FNanchor21" id="FNanchor21"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>: on this it would be impossible
to decide positively, so shattered, impaired, and defaced are the
walls, and so evidently is their coating the work of different
periods. I fancied that in some parts I could discern a mode of
construction, in layers of brick and <a name="Page_38" id=
"Page_38"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;38]</span></a>stone,
similar to that of Roman buildings in our own country, while many
of the bricks, from their texture and shape, appear also to be
Roman. Tradition, if we follow that delusive guide, teaches us that
we are contemplating a work of the middle of the eighth century,
and of one of the sons of Charles Martel. If we follow William of
Jumieges, the Chronicle of St. Vandrille, and William of Poitiers,
we ascribe it to the uncle and rival of the Conqueror; other
writers tell us that the ruins arose under Henry IInd. I dare not
decide amongst such reverend authorities, but I think I may infer,
without the least disrespect towards monks and chroniclers, that
the Norman Arques now occupies the place of a far more early
structure, and that a portion of the walls of this latter was
actually left in existence. Taken, however, as a whole, the castle
is evidently a building of different &#230;ras; and it would be
extremely difficult, if not impossible, to define the parts
belonging to each.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_06" id="plate_06"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_06.png" height="530" width="355" alt=
"Tower of remarkable shape in Arques" /></p>
<p>The principal entrance is to the west, between the two towers
first mentioned, over a draw-bridge, whose piers still remain, and
through three gateways, whose arches, though now torn and
dislocated into shapeless rents, seem to have been circular, and
probably of Norman erection. One of the towers of the gate-way
appears formerly to have been a chapel. Hence you pass into a
court, whose surface, uneven with the remains of foundations, marks
it to have been originally filled with apartments, and, at the
opposite end of this, through a square gate-house with high
embattled walls, a place evidently of great strength, and leading
into a large open space that terminated in the <a name="Page_39"
id="Page_39"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;39]</span></a>quadrangular and lofty keep.
This, which is externally strengthened by massy buttresses, similar
to those of the walls, is within divided into two apartments, each
of them about fifty feet by twenty. In one of them is a well,
communicating with a reservoir below, which is filled by the water
of the river, and was sufficiently capacious for watering the
horses of the garrison. The greatest part, if not the whole, of the
walls seems to have been faced with brick of comparatively modern
date. The keep also was coated with brick within, and with stones
carefully squared without. The windows are so battered, that no
idea can be formed of their original style. The walls of the keep
are filled with small square apertures. At Rochester, and at many
other castles in England, we observe the same; and unless you can
give a better guess respecting their use, you must content yourself
with mine: that is to say, that they are merely the holes left by
the scaffolding. At the foot of the hill to the west is a
gate-house, by no means ancient, from which a wall ascends to the
castle; and another similar wall connects the fortress with the
ground below, on the north-eastern side; but the extent or nature
of these out-works can no longer be traced. Still less possible
would it be to say any thing with certainty as to the excavations,
of the length of which, tradition speaks, as usual, in extravagant
terms, and mixes sundry marvellous and frightful tales with the
recital.</p>
<p>In the general plan a great resemblance is to be traced between
many castles in Wales and its frontiers, especially Goodrich
Castle, and this at Arques. Yet I do not think that any of ours are
of an equal extent; nor can you well conceive a more noble object
than this, when seen at a<a name="Page_40" id=
"Page_40"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;40]</span></a> distance:
and it is only then that the eye can comprehend the vast expanse
and strength of the external wall, with the noble keep towering
high above it.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_07" id="plate_07"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_07.png" height="600" width="376" alt=
"Church at Arques" /></p>
<p>Until the revolution, the decaying town of Arques was not wholly
deprived of all the vestiges of its former honours: the standards
of the weights and measures of Upper Normandy were deposited here.
It was the seat of the courts of the Archbishop of Rouen, and,
though the actual session of the municipal courts took place at
Dieppe, they bore the legal style and title of the courts of
Arques. Since the revolution these traces of its importance have
wholly disappeared, nor is there any outward indication of the
consequence once enjoyed by this poor and straggling hamlet.</p>
<p>The church is a neat and spacious building, of the same kind of
architecture as that of St. Jacques, at Dieppe; and, as it is a
good specimen of the florid Norman Gothic, (I forbid all cavils
respecting the employment of this term) I have added a figure of
it. My slender researches have not enabled me to discover the date
of the building, but it may, have been erected towards the year
1350. A most elegant bracket, formed by the graceful dolphin,
deserves the attention of the architect; and I particularize it,
not merely on account of its beauty, but because, even at the risk
of exhausting your antiquarian patience, I intend to point out all
architectural features which cannot be retraced in our own
structures; and this is one of them. By the way, Arques contributed
to increase the bulk of our herbal as well as of our sketch-book,
for under the walls of the church is found the rare <i>Erodium
moschatum</i>; and near the castle grow <i>Astragalus
glycyphyllos</i> and <i>Melissa Nepeta</i>.</p>
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;41]</span></a>
<p>The field of battle is to the southward of the town. A small
walk under the south wall of the castle, near the east end,
adjoining a covered way which led to a postern-gate or draw-bridge,
is still called the walk of Henry the IVth, because it was here
that this monarch was wont to reconnoitre the enemy's forces from
below.</p>
<p>Napol&#233;on, towards the conclusion of his reign, visited the
field of battle at Arques; he ascertained the position of the two
armies, and pronounced that the King ought to have lost the day,
for that his tactics were altogether faulty. I am willing to
suppose that this military criticism arose merely from military
pedantry, though it is now said that Napol&#233;on was envious of
the veneration, which, as the French believe, they feel for the
memory of Henri quatre. Napol&#233;on is accused of having given
the title of <i>le Roi de la Canaille</i> to the Bourbon Monarch.
And when Napol&#233;on was in full-blown pride, he might have had
the satisfaction of hearing the rabble of Paris chaunt his
comparative excellence in a parody of the old national
song&#8212;</p>

Mr. Cohen, who visited this castle nearly at the same time with
myself, and who writes me on the subject: "I feel convinced that
the brick coating of the <i>wedge-tower</i> at Arques is recent.
Such was the impression I had upon the spot; and now I cannot
remove it. It appeared to me that the character of the brick-work,
and of the stone cordons or fillets, was entirely like that of the
fortifications of the XVIth century; and I also thought, perhaps
erroneously, that the <i>wedge</i> or <i>bastion</i> was <i>affixed
to</i> the round tower of the castle, and that it was an
after-construction. At the south end of the castle, you certainly
see very ancient and singular masonry. The diagonal or herring-bone
courses are found in the old church of St. Lo, and in the keep at
Falaise; not in the front of the latter, but on the side where you
enter, and on the side which ranges with Talbot's Tower. The same
style of masonry is also seen, according to Sir Henry Englefield,
at Silchester, which is most undoubtedly a pure Roman
relic."&#8212;It abounds likewise in Colchester Castle.</p>

<h4>JOURNEY FROM DIEPPE TO ROUEN&#8212;PRIORY OF
LONGUEVILLE&#8212;ROUEN&#8212;BRIDGE OF BOATS&#8212;COSTUME OF THE
INHABITANTS.</h4>
<p class="r">(<i>Rouen, June</i>, 1818.)</p>
<p>I arrived alone at this city: my companions, who do not always
care to keep pace with my constitutional impatience, which
sometimes amuses, and now and then annoys them, made a circuit by
Havre, Bolbec, and Yvetot, while I proceeded by the straight and
beaten track. What I have thus gained in expedition, I have lost in
interest. During the whole of the ride, there was not a single
object to excite curiosity, nor would any moderate deviation from
the line of road have brought me within reach of any town or tower
worthy of notice, except the Priory of Longueville, situate to the
right of the road, about twelve miles from Dieppe. I did not see
Longueville, and I am told that the ruins are quite insignificant,
yet I regret that I did not visit them. The French can never be
made to believe that an old rubble wall is really and truly worth a
day's journey: hence their reports respecting the notability of any
given ruin can seldom be depended upon. And at least I should have
had the satisfaction of ascertaining the actual state of the
remains of a building, known to have been founded and partly built
in the year 1084, by Walter Giffard<a name="FNanchor22" id=
"FNanchor22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>,
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;43]</span></a>one of the relations and
companions of the Conqueror, in his descent upon England, and
therefore created Earl of Buckingham, or, as the French sometimes
write it, <i>Bou Kin Kan</i>. The title was held by his family only
till 1164 when, upon the decease of his son without issue, the
lands of his barony were shared among the collateral female heirs.
He himself died in 1102, and by his will directed that his body
should be brought here, which was accordingly done; and he was
buried, as Ordericus Vitalis<a name="FNanchor23" id=
"FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> tells
us, near the entrance of the church, having over him an epitaph of
eight lines, "in maceri&#226; picturis decorat&#226;." You will
find the epitaph, wherein he is styled "templi fundator et
&#230;dificator," copied both in the <i>Neustria Pia</i> and in
<i>Ducarel's Anglo-Norman Antiquities</i>. The latter speaks of it
as if it existed in his time; but the doctor seldom states the
extent of his obligations towards his predecessors. And in
consequence of this his silent gratitude, we can never tell with
any degree of certainty whether we are perusing his observations or
his transcripts. If he really saw the inscriptions with his own
eyes, it is greatly to be regretted that he has given us no
information respecting the paintings: did they still <a name=
"Page_44" id="Page_44"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;44]</span></a>exist, they would afford a most
genuine and curious proof of the state of Norman art at that remote
period; and possibly, a search after them among the cottages in the
neighborhood might even now repay the industry of some keen
antiquary; for the French revolution may well he compared to an
earthquake: it swallowed up every thing, ingulphing some so deep
that they are lost for ever, but leaving others, like hidden
treasures, buried near the surface of the soil, whence accident and
labor are daily bringing them to light. The descendants of Walter
Giffard are repeatedly mentioned as persons of importance in the
early Norman writers; nor are they less illustrious in England,
where the great family of Clare sprung from one of the daughters;
while another, by her marriage with Richard Granville, gave birth
to the various noble families of that name, of which the present
Marquis of Buckingham is the chief.</p>
<p>Of the Priory, we are told in the <i>Neustria Pia</i><a name=
"FNanchor24" id="FNanchor24"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>, that it was anciently of much
opulence, and that a Queen of France contributed largely to the
endowment of the house. Many men of eminence, particularly three of
the Talbot family, were buried within its walls. Peter Megissier, a
prior of Longueville, was in the number of the judges who passed
sentence of death upon the unfortunate Joan of Arc; and the
inscription upon his tomb is so good a specimen of monkish
Latinity, that I am tempted to send it you; reminding you at the
same time, that this barbarous system of rhyming in Latin, however
brought to perfection by the monks and therefore generally <a name=
"Page_45" id="Page_45"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;45]</span></a>called their own, is not really
of their invention, but may be found, though quoted to be
ridiculed, in the first satire of Persius,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i3">"Qui videt hunc lapidem, cognoscat qu&#242;d tegit

<p class="i1">Annis bis senis, tumidis Leo, largus egenis,</p>
<p class="i1">Omnibus indigenis charus fuit atque alienis."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I believe it is always expected, that a traveller in France
should say something respecting the general aspect of the country
and its agriculture. I shall content myself with remarking, that
this part of Normandy is marvellously like the country which the
Conqueror conquered. When the weather is dull, the Normans have a
sober English sky, abounding in Indian ink and neutral tint. And
when the weather is fine, they have a sun which is not a ray
brighter than an English sun. The hedges and ditches wear a
familiar livery, and the land which is fully cultivated repays the
toil of the husbandman with some of the most luxuriant crops of
wheat I ever saw. Barley and oats are not equally good, perhaps
from the stiffness of the soil, which is principally of chalk; but
flax is abundant and luxuriant. The surface of the ground is
undulated, and sufficiently so to make a pleasing alternation of
hill and dale; hence it is agreeably varied, though the hills never
rise to such a height as to be an obstacle to agriculture. There is
some difficulty in conjecturing where the people by whom the whole
is kept in cultivation are housed; for the number of houses by the
road-side is inconsiderable; nor did we, for the first two-thirds
of the ride, pass through a single village, excepting T&#244;tes,
which lies mid-way <a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;46]</span></a>between Dieppe, and Rouen, and
is of no great extent. Yet things in France are materially altered
in this respect since 1814, when I remember that, in going through
Calais by the way of the Low Countries to Paris, and returning by
the direct road to Boullogne, the whole journey was made without
seeing a single new house erecting in a space of four hundred
miles. This is now far from being the case; there is every where an
appearance of comparative prosperity, and, were it not for the
coins, of which the copper bear the impress of the republic, and
the gold and silver chiefly that of Napol&#233;on, a stranger would
meet with but few visible marks of the changes experienced in late
years by the government of France. Much has been also done of late
towards ornamenting the ch&#226;teaux, of which there are several
about T&#244;tes, though in the opinion of an Englishman, much also
is yet wanting. They are principally the residences of Rouen
merchants.</p>
<p>Upon approaching Malaunay, about nine miles from Rouen, the
scene is entirely changed. The road descends into a valley,
inclosed between steep hills, whose sides are richly and
beautifully clothed with wood, while the houses and church of the
village beneath add life and variety to the plain at the foot. Here
the cotton manufactories begin, and, as we follow the course of the
little river Cailly, the population gradually increases, and
continues to become more dense through a series of manufacturing
villages, each larger than the preceding, and all abounding in
noble views of hill, wood, and dale; while the tracts around are
thickly studded with picturesque residences of manufacturers, and
extensive, often <a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;47]</span></a>picturesque, manufactories. Such
indeed was the country, till we found ourselves at Rouen, shortly
before entering which the Havre road unites to that from Dieppe,
and the landscape also embraces the valley of the Seine, as well as
of the Cailly the former broader by far, and grander, but not more
beautiful.</p>
<p>Rouen, from this point of view, is seen to considerable
advantage, at least by those who, like us, make a
<i>d&#233;tour</i> to the north, and enter it in that direction:
the cathedral, St. Ouen, the hospital and church of La Madeleine,
and the river, fill the picture; nor is the impression in any wise
diminished on a nearer approach, when, through a long avenue,
formed by four rows of lofty elms, you advance by the side of a
stream, at once majestic from its width and eminently beautiful
from its winding course.</p>
<p>Rouen is now unfortified; its walls, its castles, are level with
the ground. But, if I may borrow the pun of which old Peter Heylin
is guilty when, describing Paris, Rouen is still a <i>strong</i>
city, "for it taketh you by the nose." The filth is extreme;
villainous smells overcome you in every quarter, and from every
quarter. The streets are gloomy, narrow, and crooked, and the
houses at once mean and lofty. Even on the quay, where all the
activity of commerce is visible, and where the outward signs of
opulence might be expected, there is nothing to fulfil the
expectation. Here is width and space, but no <i>trottoir</i>; and
the buildings are as incongruous as can well be imagined, whether
as to height, color, projection, or material. Most of them, and
indeed most in the city, are merely of lath and plaster, the
timbers uncovered and painted red or black, the plaster frequently
coated <a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;48]</span></a>with small grey slates laid one
over another, like the weather-tiles in Sussex. Their general form
is very tall and very narrow, which adds to the singularity of
their appearance; but mixed with these are others of white brick or
stone, and really handsome, or, it might be said, elegant. The
contrast, however, which they form only makes their neighbors look
the more shabby, while they themselves derive from the association
an air of meanness. The merchants usually meet upon a small open
plot, situated opposite to the quay, inclosed with palisades and
fronted with trees. This is their exchange in fine weather; but
adjoining is a handsome building, called <i>La Bourse &#224;
couvert</i>, or <i>Le Consulte</i>, to which recourse is always had
in case of rain. It was here that Napol&#233;on and Maria Louisa, a
very short time previous to their deposition, received from the
inhabitants of Rouen the oath of allegiance, which so soon
afterwards found a ready transfer to another sovereign.</p>
<p>About the middle of the quay is placed the bridge of boats, an
object of attraction to all strangers, but more so from the novelty
and singularity of its construction than from its beauty. Utility
rather than elegance was consulted by the builder. This far-famed
structure is ugly and cumbrous, and a passenger feels a very
unpleasing sensation if he happens to stand upon it when a loaded
waggon drives along it at low water, at which time there is a
considerable descent from the side of the suburbs. An undulatory
motion is then occasioned, which goes on gradually from boat to
boat till it reaches the opposite shore. The bridge is supported
upon nineteen large barges, which rise and fall with the tide, and
are so put together that one or <a name="Page_49" id=
"Page_49"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;49]</span></a>more can
easily be removed as often as it is necessary to allow any vessel
to pass. The whole too can be entirely taken away in six hours, a
construction highly useful in a river peculiarly liable to floods
from sudden thaws; which sometimes occasion such an increase of the
waters, as to render the lower stories of the houses in the
adjacent parts of the city uninhabitable. The bridge itself was
destroyed by a similar accident, in 1709, for want of a timely
removal. Its plan is commonly attributed to a monk of the order of
St. Augustine, by whom it was erected in 1626, about sixty years
after the stone bridge, built by the Empress Matilda in 1167, had
ceased to be passable. It seems the fate of Rouen to have
<i>wonderful</i> bridges. The present is dignified by some writers
with the high title of a <i>miracle of art</i>: the former is said
by Taillepied, in whose time it was standing, to have been "un des
plus beaux &#233;difices et des plus admirables de la France." A
few lines afterwards, however, this ingenuous writer confesses that
loaded carriages of any kind were seldom suffered to pass this
<i>admirable edifice</i>, in consequence of the expence of
repairing it; but that two barges were continually plying for the
transport of heavy goods. The delay between the destruction of the
stone bridge, and the erection of the boat bridge, appears to have
been occasioned by the desire of the citizens to have a second
similar to the first; but this, after repeated deliberations, was
at last determined to be impracticable, from the depth and rapidity
of the stream. Napol&#233;on, however, seems to have thought that
the task which had been accomplished under the auspices of the
Empress Matilda, might be again repeated in the name of the
daughter of <a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;50]</span></a>the C&#230;sars and the wife of
the successor of Charlemagne; and he actually caused Maria-Louisa
to lay the first stone of a new bridge, at some distance farther to
the east, where an island divides the river into two. This, I am
told, will certainly he finished, though at an enormous expence,
and though it will occasion great inconvenience to many inhabitants
of the quay, whose houses will be rendered useless by the height to
which it will be necessary to raise the soil upon the occasion. My
informant added, that, small as is the appearance yet made above
water, whole quarries of stone and forests of wood have been
already sunk for the purpose.</p>
<p>From the scite of the projected bridge, the view eastward is
particularly charming. The bold hill of St. Catherine presents its
steep side of bare chalk, spotted only in a few places with
vegetation or cottages, and seems to oppose an impassable barrier;
the mixture of country-houses with trees at its base, makes a most
pleasing variety; and, still nearer, the noble elms of the
<i>boulevards</i> add a character of magnificence possessed by few
other cities. The <i>boulevards</i> of Rouen are rather deficient
in the Parisian accompaniments of dancing-dogs and music-grinders,
but the sober pedestrian will, perhaps, prefer them to their
namesakes in the capital. Here they are not, as at Paris, in the
centre of the town, but they surround it, except upon the quay,
with which they unite at each end, and unite most pleasingly; so
that, immediately on leaving this brilliant bustling scene, you
enter into the gloom of a lofty embowered arcade, resembling in
appearance, as well as in effect, the public walks at Cambridge,
except that the addition of females<a name="Page_51" id=
"Page_51"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;51]</span></a> in the
fanciful Norman costume, and of the Seine, and the fine prospect
beyond, and Mont St. Catherine above, give it a new interest. On
the opposite side of the Seine, the inhabitants of Rouen have
another excellent promenade in the <i>grand cours</i>, which, for a
considerable space, occupies the bank of the river, turning
eastward from the bridge. Four rows of trees divide it into three
separate walks, of which the central one is by far the widest, and
serves for horses and carriages; the other two are appropriated
exclusively to foot passengers. In these, on a summer's evening,
are to be seen all classes of the inhabitants of Rouen, from the
highest to the lowest; and the following sketch, which you will
easily perceive to be from a pencil more delicate than mine, gives
a most lively and faithful picture of them. It may indeed be in
some measure in the nature of a treatise <i>de re
vestiari&#225;</i>, yet such details of gowns and petticoats never
fail to interest, at least to interest me, when proceeding from a
wearer.</p>

<p>"Our carriage had scarcely stopped when we were surrounded with
beggars, principally women with children in their arms. The poor
babes presented a most pitiable appearance, meagre, dirty to the
utmost degree, ragged and flea-bitten, so that round the throat
there was not the least portion of "carnation" appearing to be free
from the insect plague. Their hair, too, is seldom cut; and I have
seen girls of eight or ten years of age, bearing a growing crop
which had evidently remained unshorn, and I may add, uncombed, from
the time of their birth. It is impossible not to dread coming into
contact with these imps, who, when old, are among the ugliest
conceivable <a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;52]</span></a>specimens of the human race. The
women, even those who inhabit the towns, live much in the open air:
besides being employed in many slavish offices, they sit at their
doors or windows pursuing their business, or lounge about, watching
passengers to obtain charity. Thus their faces and necks are always
of a copper color, and, at an advanced age, more dusky still; so
that, for the anatomy and coloring of witches, a painter needs look
no further. Their wretchedness is strongly contrasted by the gaiety
of the higher classes. The military, who, I suppose, as usual in
France, hold the first place, appear in all possible variety of
keeping and costume, with their well-proportioned figures, clean
apparel, decided gait, martial air, and whiskered faces. Here and
there we see gliding along the well-dressed lady (not well dressed,
indeed, as far as becomingness goes, but fashionably), with a gown
of triple flounces, whose skirt intrudes even upon the shoulders,
obliterating the waist entirely, while her throat is lost in an
immense frill of four or more ranks; and sometimes a large shawl
over all completes the disguise of the shape. The head of the dame
or damsel is usually enveloped in a gauze or silk bonnet,
sufficiently large to spread, were it laid upon a table, two feet
in diameter, and trimmed with various-colored ribbons and
artificial flowers: in the hand is seen the ridicule, a
never-failing accompaniment. The lower orders of women at Rouen
usually wear the Cauchoise cap, or an approach to it, rising high
to a narrowish point at top, and furnished with immense ears or
wings that drop on the shoulder, then opening in front so as to
allow to be seen on the forehead a small portion of hair, which
divides and falls <a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;53]</span></a>in two or three spiral ringlets
on each side of the face. The remainder of the dress is generally
composed of a colored petticoat, probably striped, an apron of a
different color, a bodice still differing in tint from the rest,
and a shawl, uniting all the various hues of all the other parts of
the dress. Some of the peasants from the country look still more
picturesque, when mounted on horseback bringing vegetables: they
keep their situation without saddle or stirrup, and seem perfectly
at ease. But the best figures on horseback are the young men who
take out their masters' horses to give them exercise, and who are
frequently seen on the <i>grand cours</i>. They ride without hat,
coat, saddle, or saddle-cloth, and with the shirt sleeves rolled up
above the elbow. Their negligent equipment, added to their short,
curling hair, and the ease and elasticity they display in the
management of their horses, gives them, on the whole, a great
resemblance to the Grecian warriors of the Elgin marbles. Men, as
well as women, are frequently seen without hats in the streets, and
continually uncravatted; and when their heads are covered, these
coverings are of every shape and hue; from the black beaver, with
or without a rim, through all gradations of cap, to the simple
white cotton nightcap. A painter would delight in this display of
forms and these sparkling touches of color, especially when
contrasted with the grey of the city, and the tender tints of the
sky, water, and distance, and the broad coloring of the
landscape."</p>

<h4>JOURNEY TO HAVRE&#8212;PAYS DE CAUX&#8212;ST.
VALLERY&#8212;F&#201;CAMP&#8212;THE PRECIOUS BLOOD&#8212;THE
ABBEY&#8212;TOMBS IN IT&#8212;MONTIVILLIERS&#8212;HARFLEUR.</h4>
<p class="r">(<i>Rouen, June</i>, 1818.)</p>
<p>Lest I should deserve to be visited with the censure which I
have taken the liberty of passing upon Ducarel's tour, I shall
begin by premising that my account of the present state of the
tract, intended for the subject of this and the following letter,
is wholly derived from the journals of my companions. Their road by
F&#233;camp, Havre, Bolbec, and Yvetot, has led them through the
greater part of the Pays de Caux, a district which, in the time of
C&#230;sar, was peopled by the Caletes or Caleti. Antiquaries
suppose, that in the name of this tribe, they discover the traces
of its Celtic origin, and that its radical is no other than the
word <i>Kalt</i> or <i>Celt</i> itself. As a proof of the
correctness of this etymology, Bourgueville<a name="FNanchor25" id=
"FNanchor25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> tells
us that but little more than two hundred years have passed since
its inhabitants, now universally called <i>Cauchois</i>, were not
less commonly called <i>Caillots</i> or <i>Caillettes</i>; a name
which still remains attached to several families, as well as to the
village Gonfreville la Caillotte, and, probably, to some others. I
shall, however, waive all Celtic theory, "for that way madness
lies," and enter upon more sober chorography.</p>
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;55]</span></a>
<p>The author of the Description of Upper Normandy states, that the
territory known by that appellation was limited to the Pays de Caux
and the Vexin: the former occupying the line of sea-coast from the
Br&#234;le to the Seine, together with the governments of Eu and
Havre and the Pays de Brai; the latter comprising the Roumois, and
the French as well as the Norman Vexin. All these territorial
divisions have, indeed, been obliterated by the state-geographers
of the revolution; and Normandy, time-honored Normandy herself, has
disappeared from the map of the dominions of the French king. The
ancient duchy is severed into the five departments of the Seine
Inf&#233;rieure, the Eure, the Orne, Calvados, and the Manche.
These are the only denominations known to the government or to the
law, yet they are scarcely received in common parlance. The people
still speak of Normandy, and they still take a pleasure in
considering themselves as Normans: and, I too, can share in their
attachment to a name, which transmits the remembrance of actual
sovereignty and departed glory.</p>
<p>Until the re-union of feudal Normandy to the crown of its liege
lord, the duke was one of the twelve peers of the kingdom; and to
his hands that kingdom entrusted the sacred Oriflamme, as often as
it was expedient to unfurl it in war. Normandy also contained
several titular duchies, ancient fiefs held of the King as Duke of
Normandy, but which, out of favour to their owners, were "erected,"
as the French lawyers say, into duchies, after the province had
reverted to the crown. This erection, however, gave but a title to
the noble owner, <a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;56]</span></a>without increasing his
territorial privileges; nor could any of our Richards, or our
Henries, have allowed a liege man to write himself duke, like his
proud feudal suzerein. The recent duchies were Alen&#231;on,
Aumale, Harcourt, Damville, Elbeuf, Etouteville, and Longueville,
and three of them were included in the Pays de Gaux, the
inhabitants of which, from the titles connected with it, were
accustomed to dignify it with the epithet of <i>noble</i>. Their
claim to the epithet is thus given by an ancient Norman poet of the
fifteenth century; and if, according to the old tradition, which
Voltaire has bantered with his usually incredulity, we could admit
that Yvetot was ever really a kingdom, it must be allowed that few
provinces could produce such a titled terrier:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Au noble Pays de Caux</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Y a quatre Abbayes royaux,</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Six Prieur&#233;s conventionaux,</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Et six Barons de grand arroi,</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Quatre Comtes, trois Ducs, un Roi."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The soil of the district is generally rich; but the farmers
frequently suffer from drought, especially in its western part,
where they are obliged almost constantly to have recourse to
artifical irrigation. The houses and villages are all surrounded
with hedges, thickly planted, and each village is also belted in
the same manner. These inclosures, which are peculiar to the Pays
de Caux, give a monotonous appearance to the landscape, but they
are highly beneficial, for they break the force of the winds, and
furnish the inhabitants with fuel. If my memory does not deceive
me, the towns either of the ancient Gauls or Teutons, are described
as being thus encompassed in <a name="Page_57" id=
"Page_57"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;57]</span></a>primitive
times; but I cannot name my authorities for the assertion.</p>
<p>St. Vallery, the first stage beyond Dieppe, is situated in a
valley; and there is an obscure tradition that this valley was once
watered by a river, which disappeared some centuries ago. It is
conjectured, from the name of the town, that it claims an origin as
high as the seventh century, when the disciples of St. Vallery were
obliged to quit their original monastery and take refuge elsewhere.
Yet, according to other authorities<a name="FNanchor26" id=
"FNanchor26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>, it did
not receive its present appellation till 1197, when Richard
C&#339;ur de Lion, after having destroyed the town and abbey of St.
Vallery sur Somme, carried off the relics of the patron saint, and
deposited them in this town. My reporters tell me that it has an
air of antiquity and gloom, but that it contains nothing worthy of
notice except a crucifix in the churchyard, of stone, richly
wrought, dated 1575, and a <i>b&#233;nitier</i> of such simple form
and rude workmanship, as to appear of considerable antiquity. The
place itself is only a wretched residence for four or five thousand
fishermen; but still it has a name<a name="FNanchor27" id=
"FNanchor27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> in
history. Hence William sailed for the conquest of England; and its
harbor, all poor and small as it is, has always been considered of
importance to the country; there being no other between Havre and
Dieppe capable of affording shelter to vessels of even a moderate
size.</p>
<p>The road to F&#233;camp passes through the little town of Cany,
situated in a beautiful valley; and there my family met the
Archbishop of Rouen, who, at this moment, is <a name="Page_58" id=
"Page_58"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;58]</span></a>in
progress through his diocese, for the purpose of confirmation. The
approach of his eminence gave the appearance of a fair to every
village: young and old of both sexes were collected in the highways
to welcome the prelate. He travelled in considerable state,
attended by a military escort of twenty men; and arrayed in the
scarlet robe of a Roman Cardinal, with the brilliant "decoration"
of the Legion of Honor conspicuous upon his breast. For the
archbishop is a grand officer of that brotherhood of bastard
chivalry; and this ornament, conjoined to his train of whiskered
warriors, seemed to render him a very type of the church militant.
His eminence is extremely bulky; and my pilgrims were wicked enough
to be much amused by the oddity of his pomp and pride. Nor did the
postillion spare his facetiousness on the occasion; for you are
aware that in France, as in most other parts of the continent, the
servile classes use a degree of familiarity in their intercourse
with their betters, to which we are little accustomed in England,
and which has given rise to the Italian proverb, that "Il Francese
&#232; fedele, l'Italiano rispettoso, l'Inglese schiavo<a name=
"FNanchor28" id="FNanchor28"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>."</p>
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;59]</span></a>
<p>Throughout this part of France, large flocks of sheep are
commonly seen in the vicinity of the sea, and, as the pastures are
uninclosed, they are all regularly guarded by a shepherd and his
black dog, whose activity cannot fail to be a subject of
admiration. He is always on the alert and attentive to his
business, skirting his flock to keep them from straggling, and
that, apparently, without any directions <a name="Page_60" id=
"Page_60"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;60]</span></a>from his
master. In the night they are folded upon the ploughed land; and
the shepherd lodges, like a Tartar in his <i>kibitka</i>, in a
small cart roofed and fitted up with doors.</p>
<p>F&#233;camp, like other towns in the neighborhood, is imbedded
in a deep valley; and the road, on approaching it, threads through
an opening between hills "stern and wild," a tract of "brown heath
and shaggy wood," resembling many parts of Scotland. The town is
long and straggling, the streets steep and crooked; its
inhabitants, according to the official account of the population of
France, amount to seven thousand, and the number of its houses is
estimated at thirteen hundred, besides above a third of that
quantity which are deserted, and more or less in ruins<a name=
"FNanchor29" id="FNanchor29"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>F&#233;camp appeared desolate and decaying to its visitors, but
they recollected that its very desolation was a voucher of the
antiquity from which it derives its interest. It claims an origin
as high as the days of C&#230;sar, when it was called <i>Fisci
Campus</i>, being the station where the tribute was collected.</p>
<p>It is in vain, however, to expect concord amongst etymologists;
and, of course, there are other right learned wights who protest
against this derivation. They shake their heads and say, "no; you
must trace the name, F&#233;camp, to <i>Fici Campus</i>;" and they
strengthen their assertion by a sort of <i>argumentum ad
ecclesiam</i>, maintaining that the <i>precious blood</i>, for
which F&#233;camp was long celebrated, corroborates and confirms
their tale. A chapel in the abbey church attests the sanctity of
this relic. The legend states that Nicodemus, at the time of the
entombment <a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;61]</span></a>of our Saviour, collected in a
phial the blood from his wounds, and bequeathed it to his nephew,
Isaac; who afterwards, making a tour through Gaul, stopped in the
Pays de Caux, and buried the phial at the root of a
fig-tree<a name="FNanchor30" id="FNanchor30"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Nor is this the only miracle connected with the church. The
monkish historians descant with florid eloquence upon the white
stag, which pointed out to Duke Ansegirus the spot where the
edifice was to be erected; the mystic knife, inscribed "in nomine
sanct&#230; et individu&#230; trinitatis," thus declaring to whom
the building should be dedicated; and the roof, which, though
prepared for a distant edifice, felt that it would be best at
F&#233;camp, and actually, of its own accord, undertook a voyage by
sea, and landed, without the displacing of a single nail, upon the
sea-coast near the town. All these <i>contes d&#233;vots</i>, and
many others, you will find recorded in the <i>Neustria
Pia</i><a name="FNanchor31" id="FNanchor31"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>. I will only detain you with a
few words more upon the subject of the <i>precious blood</i>, a
matter too important to be thus hastily dismissed. It was placed
here by Duke Richard I.; but was lost in the course of a long and
turbulent period, and was not found again till the year 1171, when
it was discovered within the substance of a column built in the
wall. Two little tubes of lead originally contained the treasure;
but these were soon inclosed in two others of a more precious
metal, and the whole was laid at the bottom of a box of gilt
silver, placed in a beautiful pyramidical <a name="Page_62" id=
"Page_62"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;62]</span></a>shrine.
Thus protected, it was, before the revolution, fastened to one of
the pillars of the choir, behind a trellis-work of copper, and was
an object of general adoration. I know not what has since become of
it; but, as they are now managing these matters better in France,
we may safely calculate upon the speedy reappearance of the relic.
Nor must you refer this legend to the many which protestant
incredulity is too apt to class with the idle tales of all ages,
the</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
<p>for no less grave an authority than the faculty of theology at
Paris determined, by a formal decree of the 28th of May, 1448, that
this worship was very proper; for that, to use their words, "Non
repugnat pietati fidelium credere qu&#242;d aliquid de sanguine
Christi effuso tempore passionis remanserit in terris."</p>
<p>The abbey, to which F&#233;camp was indebted for all its
greatness and celebrity, was founded in 664<a name="FNanchor32" id=
"FNanchor32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> for a
community of nuns, by Waning, the count or governor of the Pays de
Caux, a nobleman who had already contributed to the endowment of
the Monastery of St. Wandrille. St. Ouen, Bishop of Rouen,
dedicated the church in the presence of King Clotaire; and, so
rapidly did the fame of the sanctity of the abbey extend, that the
number of its inmates amounted in a very short period to three
hundred or more. The arrival, however, of the Normans, under
Hastings, in 841, caused the dispersion of the nuns; and the same
story is related of the few <a name="Page_63" id=
"Page_63"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;63]</span></a>who
remained at F&#233;camp, as of many others under similar
circumstances, that they voluntarily cut off their noses and their
lips, rather than be an object of attraction to the lust of their
conquerors. The abbey, in return for their heroism, was levelled
with the ground, and it did not rise from its ashes till the year
988, when the piety of Duke Richard I. built the church anew, under
the auspices of his son, Robert, Archbishop of Rouen; but,
departing from the original foundation, he established therein a
chapter of regular canons, who, however, were so irregular in their
conduct, that within ten years they were doomed to give way to a
body of Benedictine Monks, headed by an Abbot, named William, from
a convent at Dijon. From his time the monastery continued to
increase in splendor. Three suffragan abbies, that of Notre Dame at
Bernay, of St. Taurin at Evreux, and of Ste. Berthe de Blangi, in
the diocese of Boullogne, owned the superior power of the abbot of
F&#233;camp, and supplied the three mitres which he proudly bore on
his abbatial shield. Kings and princes in former ages frequently
paid the abbey the homage of their worship and their gifts; and, in
a period nearer to our own, Casimir of Poland, after his voluntary
abdication of the throne, selected it as the spot in which he
sought for repose, when wearied with the cares of royalty. The
English possessions of F&#233;camp (for like most of the great
Norman abbeys, it held lands in our island) do not appear to have
been large; but, according to an author of our own country<a name=
"FNanchor33" id="FNanchor33"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> the abbot presented to one
hundred and thirty benefices, some in the diocese of Rouen, others
in those of Bayeux, Lisieux, Coutances, Chartres, and <a name=
"Page_64" id="Page_64"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;64]</span></a>Beauvais; and it enjoyed so many
estates, that its income was said to be forty thousand crowns per
annum. F&#233;camp moreover could boast of a noble library, well
stored with manuscripts<a name="FNanchor34" id=
"FNanchor34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a>, and
containing among its archives many original charters, deeds,
&amp;c. of William the Conqueror, and several of his
successors.</p>
<p>This magnificent church is three hundred and seventy feet long
and seventy high; the transept, including the Chapel of the
Precious Blood, one hundred and twenty feet long; the tower two
hundred feet high. A portion of it was burned in 1460, but soon
repaired. William de Ros, third abbot, rebuilt all the upper part
in a better taste, and enlarged the nave, which was not finished
till 1200. A successor of his at the beginning of the next century
completed the chapels round the choir. The screen was begun by one
of the monks about 1500, who erected the chapel dedicated to the
death of the Virgin, a master-piece of architecture and adorned
with historical carving. The cloister was built so late as 1712.
Cathedral service was performed in the church, in which were the
tombs of the first and second of the Richards of Normandy; of
Richard, infant son of the former, and of William, third son of the
latter; of Margaret, betrothed to Robert, son of William the
Conqueror, who died 1060; of Alard, third Earl of Bretagne, 1040;
of <a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;65]</span></a>Archbishop Osmond, and of a Lady
Judith, whose jingling epitaph has given rise to a variety of
conjectures, whether she was the wife of Duke Richard IInd, or his
daughter, or some other person.&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">

<p class="i1">Primo jus subiit sed mod&#242; jura regit."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As to Duke Richard Ist, he caused a sarcophagus of stone to be
made and placed within this church; and so long as he lived, it was
filled with wheat on every Friday, and the grain, together with
five shillings, distributed weekly among the poor. And when his
death approached, he expressly charged his successor, "Bury not my
body within the church, but deposit it on the outside, immediately
under the eaves, that the dripping of the rain from the holy roof
may wash my bones as I lie, and may cleanse them of the spots of
impurity contracted during a negligent and neglected life."</p>
<p>Our party could not ascertain whether any of the historical
monuments were yet in existence. The church, at the time they were
there, was wholly occupied with preparations for the approaching
confirmation. Young girls in their best dresses, all in white, and
holding tapers in their hands, filled the nave, while the chapels
were crowded with individuals at prayer, or still more with females
waiting for an opportunity of confessing themselves, previously to
receiving the expected absolution from the archbishop. Under such
circumstances nothing could be examined; but there appeared to be
in the chapels five or six fine, though mutilated, altar tombs: to
whom, however, they belonged, or what was their actual state,
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;66]</span></a>it was impossible to tell.
Accompanying them are also some curious pieces of sculpture. For
the same reason no farther remark could be made upon the interior
of the building, except that its architecture is imposing, and its
roof, supported by tall clustered pillars, has much the general
effect of the nave of our cathedral at Norwich, one of the purest
specimens of Norman architecture in England. Externally the tower
is handsome, and of nearly the earliest pointed style; not
altogether so, as its arches, though narrow, contain each a double
arch within. The rest of the building seems to have suffered much
from alterations and dilapidation; and whatever tracery there may
have been originally has disappeared from the windows; nor are
there saints or even niches remaining above the doors.</p>
<p>The exterior of the church of St. Etienne, one of the ten
parochial churches of F&#233;camp, before the revolution, is
considerably more imposing; but upon this I will not detain you, as
you will see it engraved in Mr. Cotman's <i>Architectural
Antiquities of Normandy</i>, from a sketch taken by him last
year.</p>
<p>Henry IInd, of England, made a donation of the town to the
abbey, whose seignorial jurisdiction also extended over many other
parishes, as well in this as in the adjoining dioceses. Its
exclusive privileges were likewise ample. Under the first and
second race, F&#233;camp was the seat of government of the Pays de
Caux, and the residence of the counts of the district: it was also
a residence of the Norman Dukes. Their castle was rebuilt by
William Longue-Epe&#233;, with a degree of magnificence which is
said to have been extraordinary. This duke took particular pleasure
in the place, and he and his immediate <a name="Page_67" id=
"Page_67"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;67]</span></a>successors
frequently lived here. But the palace has long since
disappeared<a name="FNanchor35" id="FNanchor35"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>: the continual increase of the
monastic buildings gradually occupied its place; and they, in their
turn, are now experiencing the revolutions of fortune, the
inhabitants being at this very time actively employed in their
demolition.</p>
<p>The town is at present wholly supported by the fisheries, in
which are employed about fourteen hundred sailors<a name=
"FNanchor36" id="FNanchor36"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a>. The herrings of F&#233;camp
have always had the same high character in France, as those of
Lowestoft and Yarmouth in England. The armorial lion of our own
town ends, as you know, with the tail of a herring; and I really
have been often inclined to affix the same appendage to the rump of
the lion of Normandy. You are not much of an epicure, nor are you
very likely to search in the <i>Almanach des Gourmands</i> for
dainties; if you did, you would probably find there the following
proverb, which has existed since the thirteenth century,&#8212;</p>

</div>
<p>The fortifications of F&#233;camp are destroyed; but, upon the
cliffs which command the town, there still remain some slight
vestiges of a fort, erected in the time of <a name="Page_68" id=
"Page_68"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;68]</span></a>Henry
IVth, when the inhabitants espoused the party of the league. The
capture of this fort was one of those gallant exploits which the
historian delights in recording; and it is detailed at great length
in Sully's Memoirs<a name="FNanchor37" id="FNanchor37"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>From F&#233;camp to Havre the country is well wooded, and much
applied to the cultivation of flax, which flourishes in this
neighborhood, and has given rise to considerable linen
manufactories. The trees look well in masses, but individually they
are trimmed into ugliness. Near Havre the road goes through
Montivilliers, and, still nearer, through Harfleur.</p>
<p>The first of these is, like F&#233;camp, a place of antiquity,
and derived its name<a name="FNanchor38" id=
"FNanchor38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> and
importance from a monastery which was founded at the end of the
seventh century. Its history is headed by the chapter which begins
the records of most of the ecclesiastical foundations of the duchy:
when the invading heathen Normans reached Montivilliers, it shared
the common fate of destruction, and when they withdrew, the common
piety recalled it to existence. Richard IInd bestowed it upon
F&#233;camp, but the same sovereign restored it to its
independence, at the request of his aunt, Beatrice, who retired
hither as abbess, at the head of a community of nuns. A convent,
over which an abbess of royal blood had presided, could not fail to
enjoy considerable privileges; and it retained them to the period
of the revolution. The tower of the church still remains, a noble
specimen of the Norman architecture of the eleventh century, at
which period the building is known to have been erected. The rest
of the edifice, <a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;69]</span></a>though handsome as a whole, is
the work of different &#230;ras. The archives of the monastery
furnish an account of large sums expended in additions and
alterations in the years 1370 and 1513. The interior contains some
elegant stone fillagree-work in the form of a small gallery or
pulpit, attached to the west end near the roof, and probably
intended to receive a band of singers on high festivals. A gallery
of a similar nature, but of wood, and to which the foregoing
purpose was assigned by the learned wight, John Carter, is yet
remaining at the north-west corner of Westminster Abbey. You and I,
who are sadly inclined to admire ugliness and antiquity, would have
been better pleased with the capitals of the pillars, which are
evidently coeval with the tower. Drawings were made of some of
these capitals, and I have selected two which appeared to be the
most singular.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_02" id="picture_02"></a><br />
<img src="images/picture_02.png" height="174" width="220" alt=
"Capital with Angel" /></p>
<p>In this you observe an angel weighing the good works of the
deceased against his evil deeds; and, as the former are far
exceeding the avoirdupois upon which <a name="Page_70" id=
"Page_70"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;70]</span></a>Satan is
to found his claim, he is endeavoring most unfairly to depress the
scale with his two-pronged fork.</p>
<p>This allegory is of frequent occurrence in the monkish
legends.&#8212;The saint, who was aware of the frauds of the fiend,
resolved to hold the balance himself.&#8212;He began by throwing in
a pilgrimage to a miraculous virgin.&#8212;The devil pulled out an
assignation with some fair mortal Madonna, who had ceased to be
immaculate.&#8212;The saint laid in the scale the sackcloth and
ashes of the penitent of Lenten-time.&#8212;Satan answered the
deposit by the vizard and leafy-robe of the masker of the
carnival.&#8212;Thus did they still continue equally interchanging
the sorrows of godliness with the sweets of sin, and still the
saint was distressed beyond compare, by observing that the scale of
the wicked thing (wise men call him the correcting principle,)
always seemed the heaviest. Almost did he despair of his client's
salvation, when he luckily saw eight little jetty black claws just
hooking and clenching over the rim of the golden basin. The claws
at once betrayed the craft of the cloven foot. Old Nick had put a
little cunning young devil under the balance, who, following the
dictates of his senior, kept clinging to the scale, and swaying it
down with all his might and main. The saint sent the imp to his
proper place in a moment, and instantly the burthen of
transgression was seen to kick the beam.</p>
<p>Painters and sculptors also often introduced this ancient
allegory of the balance of good and evil, in their representations
of the last judgment: it was even employed by Lucas Kranach.</p>
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;71]</span></a>
<p>The other capital which I send to you is ornamented with groups
of Centaurs or Sagittaries. Astronomical sculptures are frequently
found upon the monuments of the middle ages. Two capitals, forming
part of a series of zodiacal sculptures, are preserved in the
<i>Mus&#233;e des Monumens Fran&#231;ais</i>; and, speaking from
memory, I think they bear a near resemblance in style to that which
is here represented.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_03" id="picture_03"></a><br />
<img src="images/picture_03.png" height="150" width="191" alt=
"Capital with Centaurs or Sagittaries" /></p>
<p>Montivilliers itself is a neat little town, beautifully situated
in a valley, with a stream of clear water running through it. At
this time its trade is trifling; but the case was otherwise in
former days, when its cloths were considered to rival those of
Flanders, and the preservation of the manufacture was regarded of
so much consequence, that sundry regulations respecting it are to
be found in the royal ordinances. One of them in particular, of the
fourteenth century, notices the frauds committed by other towns in
imitating the mark of the cloth of Montivilliers.</p>
<p>The general appearance of Harfleur is much like that of
Montivilliers; but numerous remains of walls and gates <a name=
"Page_72" id="Page_72"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;72]</span></a>denote that it was once of still
greater comparative importance. The ancient trade of the place is
now transferred to Havre de Grace, the situation of the latter town
being far more elegible.</p>
<p>The Seine no longer rolls its waves under Harfleur; and the
desiccated harbor is now seen as a verdant meadow. Without the aid
of history, therefore, you would in vain inquire into the
derivation of the name, in connection with which, the learned Huet,
Bishop of Avranches<a name="FNanchor39" id=
"FNanchor39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>, calls
upon us to remark, that the names of many places in Normandy end in
<i>fleur</i>, as Barfleur, Harfleur, Honfleur, Fiefleur, Vitefleur,
&amp;c.; and that, if, as it is commonly supposed, this termination
comes from <i>fluctus</i>, it must have passed through the Saxon,
in which language <i>fleoten</i> signifies <i>to flow</i>. Hence we
have <i>flot</i>, and from <i>flot, fleut</i> and <i>fleur</i>, the
last alteration being warranted by the genius of the French
language. The bishop further states, that there are two facts,
affording a decisive proof of this origin: the one, that the names
now terminating in <i>fleur</i>, ended anciently <i>flot</i>,
Barfleur being Barbeflot, Harfleur Hareflot, and Honfleur Huneflot;
the other, that all places so called are situated where they are
washed by the tide. Such is also the position of the towns in
Holland, whose names terminate in <i>vliet</i>, and of those in
England, ending in <i>fleet</i>, as Purfleet, Byfleet, &amp;c. The
Latin word <i>flevus</i> is of the same kind, and is derived from
the same source; for, instead of Hareflot and Huneflot, some old
records have Hareflou and Huneflou, and some others Barfleu, terms
approaching <i>flevus</i>, which is also called by Ptolemy,
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;73]</span></a><i>fleus</i>, and by Mela,
<i>fletio</i>. It is highly improbable, that these two last terms
should have been coined subsequently to the time of the Romans
becoming masters of Gaul, and it is equally unlikely that the Saxon
<i>fleoten</i> should be derived from the Latin. Thus far,
therefore, the languages appear to have had a common origin, and
they are insomuch allied to the Celtic, that those towns in
Britanny, in whose names are found the syllables <i>pleu</i> and
<i>plou</i>, are also invariably placed in similar situations.</p>
<p>If, however, I am fairly embarked in the sea of etymological
conjecture, I know not where I shall be carried; and therefore,
instead of urging the probability that the root of the Celtic
<i>pleu</i> is apparently to be found in the Pelasgic
&#960;&#955;&#949;&#969;, I shall return to Harfleur and its
history. Whilst Harfleur was in its glory, it was considered the
key of the Seine and of this part of France. In 1415 it opposed a
vigorous resistance to our Henry Vth, who had no sooner made
himself master of it, than, with a degree of contradiction, which
teaches man to regard the performance of his duty to God as no
reason for his performing it to his fellow-creatures, "the King
uncovered his feet and legs, and walked barefoot from the gate to
the parish church of St. Martin, where he very devoutly offered up
his prayers and thanksgivings for his success. But, immediately
afterwards he made all the nobles and the men at arms that were in
the town his captives, and shortly after sent the greater part out
of the place, clothed in their jerkins only, taking down their
names and surnames in writing, and obliging them to swear by their
faith that they would surrender themselves prisoners at Calais on
Martinmas-day next ensuing. In like manner <a name="Page_74" id=
"Page_74"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;74]</span></a>were the
townsmen made prisoners, and obliged to ransom themselves for large
sums of money. Afterwards did the King banish them out of the town,
with numbers of women and children, to each of whom were given five
sols and a portion of their garments." Monstrelet<a name=
"FNanchor40" id="FNanchor40"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>, from whom I have transcribed
this detail, adds, that "it was pitiful to hear and see the sorrow
of these poor people, thus driven away from their homes; the
priests and clergy were likewise dismissed; and, in regard to the
wealth found there, it was not to be told, and appertained even to
the King, who distributed it as he pleased." Other writers tell us
that the number of those thus expelled was eight thousand, and that
the conqueror, not satisfied with this act of vengeance, publicly
burned the charters and archives of the town and the title-deeds of
individuals, re-peopled Harfleur with English, and forbad the few
inhabitants that remained to possess or inherit any landed
property. After a lapse, however, of twenty years, the peasants of
the neighboring country, aided by one hundred and four of the
inhabitants, retook the place by assault. The exploit was gallant;
and a custom continued to prevail in Harfleur, for above two
centuries subsequently, intended to commemorate it; a bell was
tolled one hundred and four times every morning at day-break, being
the time when the attack was made. In 1440, the citizens,
undismayed by the sufferings of their predecessors, withstood a
second siege from our countrymen, whom the town resisted four
months, and in whose possession it remained ten years, when Charles
VIIIth permanently united it to the crown of France.
Notwithstanding these calamities, <a name="Page_75" id=
"Page_75"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;75]</span></a>it rose
again to a state of prosperity, till the revocation of the edict of
Nantes gave the death-blow to its commerce; and intolerance
completed the desolation which war had begun. At present, it is
only remarkable for the elegant tower and spire of its church,
connected by flying buttresses of great beauty, the whole of rich
and elaborate workmanship.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_09" id="plate_09"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_09.png" height="432" width="132" alt=
"Tower and Spire of Harfleur Church" /></p>
<p>At a short distance from Harfleur, the Seine comes in view,
flowing into the sea through a fine rich valley; but the wide
expanse of water has no picturesque beauty. The hills around Havre
are plentifully spotted with gentlemen's houses, few only of which
have been seen in other parts in the ride. The town itself is
strongly fortified; and, having conducted you hither, I shall leave
you for the present, reserving for another letter any particulars
respecting Havre, and the rest of the road to Rouen.</p>

"#FNanchor28">[28]</a> Heylin notices the familiarity of the
approach of the French servants, in his delineation of a Norman
inn. An extract may amuse those who are not familiar with the works
of this quaint yet sensible writer. "There stood in the chamber
three beds, if at the least it be lawful so to call them; the
foundation of them was straw, so infinitely thronged together, that
the wool-packs which our judges sit on in the Parliament, were
melted butter to them; upon this lay a medley of flocks and
feathers sewed up together in a large bag, (for I am confident it
was not a tick) but so ill ordered that the knobs stuck out on each
side like a crab-tree cudgel. He had need to have flesh enough that
lyeth on one of them, otherwise the second night would wear out his
bones.&#8212;Let us now walk into the kitchen and observe their
provision. And here we found a most terrible execution committed on
the person of a pullet; my hostess, cruel woman, had cut the throat
of it, and without plucking off the feathers, tore it into pieces
with her hands, and afterwards took away skin and feathers
together: this done, it was clapped into a pan and fried for
supper.&#8212;But the principal ornaments of these inns are the
men-servants, the raggedest regiment that ever I yet looked upon;
such a thing as a chamberlain was never heard of amongst them, and
good clothes are as little known as he. By the habits of his
attendants a man would think himself in a gaol, their clothes are
either full of patches or open to the skin. Bid one of them make
clean your boots, and presently he hath recourse to the
curtains.&#8212;They wait always with their hats on, and so do all
servants attending on their masters.&#8212;Time and use reconciled
me to many other things, which, at the first were offensive; to
this most irreverent custom I returned an enemy; <i>neither can I
see how it can choose but stomach the most patient</i> to see the
worthiest sign of liberty usurped and profaned by the basest of
slaves."&#8212;Peter then has a learned <i>excursus de jure
pileorum</i>, wherein <i>Tertullian de Spectaculis, Erasmus</i> his
<i>Chiliades</i>, and many other reverent authorities are adduced;
also, giving an account of his successful exertions, as to "the
licence of putting on our caps at our public meetings, which
privilege, time, and the tyranny of the vice-chancellor, had taken
from." After which, he still resumes in ire,&#8212;"this French
sauciness hath drawn me out of the way; an impudent familiarity,
which, I confess, did much offend me; and to which I still profess
myself an open enemy. Though Jacke speak French, I cannot endure
Jacke should be a gentleman."</p>

<h2>LETTER VI.</h2>
<h4>HAVRE&#8212;TRADE AND HISTORY OF THE TOWN&#8212;EMINENT
MEN&#8212;BOLBEC&#8212;YVETOT&#8212;RIDE TO ROUEN&#8212;FRENCH
BEGGARS.</h4>
<p class="r">(<i>Rouen, June</i>, 1818.)</p>
<p>To F&#233;camp and the other places noticed in my last letter, a
more striking contrast could not easily be found than Havre. It
equally wants the interest derived from ancient history, and the
appearance of misery inseparable from present decay. And yet even
Havre is now suffering and depressed. A town which depends
altogether upon foreign commerce, could not fail to feel the
effects of a long maritime war; and we accordingly find the number
of its inhabitants, which twenty years ago was estimated at
twenty-five thousand, now reduced to little more than sixteen
thousand.</p>
<p>The blow, which Havre will with most difficulty recover is the
loss of St. Domingo; for, before the revolution, it almost enjoyed
a monopoly of the trade of this important colony, in which upwards
of eighty ships, each of above three hundred tons burthen, were
constantly employed. With Martinique and Guadaloupe it had a
similar, though less extensive, intercourse. As the natural outlet
for the manufactures of Rouen and Paris, it supplied the French
islands in the West Indies with the principal part of their
plantation stores; and the situation of the port was equally
advantageous for the importation of their produce. Guinea and the
coast of Africa afforded a second and important branch of commerce;
and this <a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;77]</span></a>also is little likely entirely
to recover. We may add that, happily it is not so; for it depended
principally upon the slave-trade, the profits of which were such,
that it was calculated a vessel might clear upon an average nearly
eight thousand pounds by each voyage<a name="FNanchor41" id=
"FNanchor41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>. Its
whale-fishery has, for more than a century, ceased to exist. This
pursuit began with spirit and at as early a period as the year
1632, when the merchants of this port, in conjunction with those of
Biscay, fitted out the expedition commanded by Vrolicq, seized upon
a station near Spitzbergen, where they would have obtained a
permanent establishment, had they not been violently expelled by
the Danes and Dutch. But the coasting-trade with the various ports
of France, and the communication with the other countries of
Europe, is now again in full vigor; and it is to these sources that
Havre is chiefly indebted for the life and spirit visible in its
quays and public places.</p>
<p>The appearance of bustle and activity is a striking, at the same
time that it is a most pleasing, character, of every great and
commercial sea-port, in every part of the world: it is especially
so in a climate which is milder than our own, and where not only
the loading and unloading of the ships, with the consequent
transport of merchandize, is continually taking place before the
spectator; but the sides of the shops are commonly set open,
sail-makers are pursuing their business in rows in the streets, and
almost every handicraft and occupation is carried on in the open
air. An acute traveller might also conjecture that the mildness of
the atmosphere is comfortable and <a name="Page_78" id=
"Page_78"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;78]</span></a>congenial
to the parrots, perroquets, and monkeys, which are brought over as
pets and companions by the sailors. Great numbers of these exotic
birds and brutes are to be seen at the windows, and they almost
give to the town of Havre the appearance of a tropical
settlement.</p>
<p>The quays are strongly edged and faced with granite: the
streets, of which there are forty, are all built in straight lines,
and chiefly at right angles with each other. In them are several
fountains, round which picturesque groups of women are continually
collected, employed with Homeric industry in the task of washing
linen. The churches are ugly, their style is a miserable caricature
of Roman architecture, the interiors are incumbered by dirty and
dark chapels, filled up with wood carvings. The principal church
has figures of saints, of wretched execution, but of the size of
life, ranged round the interior. The harbor is calculated to
contain three hundred vessels. The houses are oddly constructed:
they are very narrow, and very lofty, being commonly seven stories
high, and they are mostly fronted with stripes of tiled slate, and
intermediate ones of mortar, so fantastically disposed, that two
are rarely seen alike.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding what is alledged by the author of the
<i>M&#233;moires sur Havre</i>, in his endeavors to give
consequence to his native place, by maintaining its antiquity, it
appears certain that no mention is made of the town previously to
the fifteenth century. Even so late as 1509, its scite was occupied
by a few hovels, clustered round a thatched chapel, under the
protection of Notre Dame de Grace, from whom the place derived the
name <a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;79]</span></a>of Havre de Grace. Francis Ist,
who was the real founder<a name="FNanchor42" id=
"FNanchor42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> of
Havre, was desirous of changing this name to
<i>Fran&#231;oisville</i> or <i>Franciscopole</i>. But the will of
a sovereign, as Goube very justly observes, most commonly dies with
him: in our days, the National Convention, aided by the full force
of popular enthusiasm, has equally failed in a similar attempt. The
jacobins tried in vain to banish the recollections of good St.
Denis, by unchristening his vill under the appellation of
<i>Franciade</i>. Disobedience to the edict, exposed, indeed, the
contravener to the chance of experiencing the martyrdom of the
bishop; yet the mandate still produced no effect. Nor was
Napol&#233;on more successful; and history affords abundant proof,
that it is more easy to build a city, or even to conquer a kingdom,
than to alter an established name.</p>
<p>Viewed in its present condition, no town in France unites more
advantages than Havre: it is one of the keys of the kingdom; it
commands the mouth of the river that leads direct to the
metropolis; and it is at once a great commercial town and a naval
station. Possessing such claims to commercial and military
pre-eminence, it may appear matter of surprise that it should be of
so recent an origin; but the cause is to be sought for in <a name=
"Page_80" id="Page_80"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;80]</span></a>the changes which succeeding
centuries have induced in the face of the country&#8212;</p>

</div>
<p>The sea continually loses here, and, without great efforts on
the part of man to retard the operation of the elements, Havre may,
in process of time, become what Harfleur is. At its origin it stood
immediately on the shore; the consequence of which was, that,
within a very few years, a high tide buried two-thirds of the
houses and nearly all the inhabitants. The remembrance of this
dreadful calamity is still annually renewed by a solemn procession
on the fifteenth of January.</p>
<p>With regard to historical events connected with Havre, there is
little to be said. It was the spot whence our Henry VIIth embarked,
in 1485, aided by four thousand men from Charles VIIIth, of France,
to enforce his claim to the English crown. The town was seized by
the Huguenots, and delivered to our Queen Elizabeth, in 1562. But
it was held by her only till the following year, when Charles IXth,
with Catherine of Medicis, commanded the siege in person, and
pressed it so vigorously, that the Earl of Warwick was obliged to
evacuate the place, after having sacrificed the greater part of his
troops. At the end of the following century, after the bombardment
and destruction of Dieppe, an attack was made upon Havre, but
without success, owing to the strength of the fortifications, and
particularly of the citadel. For this, the town was indebted to
Cardinal Richelieu, who was its governor for a considerable
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;81]</span></a>time, and who also erected some
of its public buildings, improved the basin, and gave a fresh
impulse to trade, by ordering several large ships of war to be
built here. As ship-builders, the inhabitants of Havre have always
had a high character: they stand conspicuous in the annals of the
art, for the construction of the vessel called <i>la Grande
Fran&#231;oise</i>, and justly termed <i>la grande</i>, as having
been of two thousand tons burthen. Her cables are said to have been
above the thickness of a man's leg; and, besides what is usually
found in a ship, she contained a wind-mill and a
tennis-court<a name="FNanchor43" id="FNanchor43"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>. Her destination was, according
to some authors, the East Indies; according to others, the Isle of
Rhodes, then attacked by Soliman IInd; but we need not now inquire
whither she was bound; for, after advantage had been taken of two
of the highest tides, the utmost which could be done was to tow her
to the end of the pier, where she stuck fast, and was finally
obliged to be cut to pieces. Her history and catastrophe are
immortalized by Rabelais, under the appellation of <i>la Grande Nau
Fran&#231;oise</i>.</p>
<p>It were unpardonable to take leave of Havre without one word
upon the celebrated individuals to whom it has given birth; and you
must allow me also, from our common taste for natural history, to
point it out to your notice as a spot peculiarly favorable for the
collecting of fossil shells, which are found about the town and
neighborhood in great numbers and variety. The Abb&#233;
Dicquemare, a naturalist of considerable eminence, who resided
here, may possibly be known to you by his observations on this
subject, or still more probably by those <a name="Page_82" id=
"Page_82"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;82]</span></a>upon the
Aetini&#230;; the latter having been translated into English, and
honored with a place in the Transactions of our Royal Society. Of
more extensive, but not more justly merited, fame, are George
Scudery and his sister Magdalen: the one a voluminous writer in his
day, though now little known, except for his <i>Critical
Observations upon the Cid</i>; the other, a still more prolific
author of novels, and alternately styled by her contemporaries the
Sappho of her age, and "un boutique de verbiage;" but
unquestionably a writer of merit, notwithstanding the many unmanly
sneers of Boileau, whose bitter pen, like that of our own
illustrious satirist, could not even consent to spare a female that
had been so unfortunate as to provoke his resentment. She died in
1701, at the advanced age of ninety-four. The last upon my list is
one of whom death has very recently deprived the world, the
excellent Bernardin de Saint Pierre; a man whose writings are not
less calculated to improve the heart than to enlarge the mind. It
is impossible to read his works without feeling love and respect
for the author. His exquisite little tale of <i>Paul and
Virginia</i> is in the hands of every body; and his larger work,
the <i>Studies of Nature</i>, deserves to be no less generally
read, as full of the most original observations, joined to theories
always ingenious, though occasionally fanciful: the whole conveyed
in a singularly captivating style, and its merits still farther
enhanced by a constant flow of unaffected piety.</p>
<p>The road from Havre to Rouen is of a different character, and
altogether unlike that from Dieppe; but what it gains in beauty of
landscape it loses in interest. And yet, perhaps, it is even wrong
to say that it gains much in point of <a name="Page_83" id=
"Page_83"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;83]</span></a>beauty;
for, though: trees are more generally dispersed, though cultivation
is universal, and the soil good, and produce luxuriant, and though
the mind and the eye cannot but be pleased by the abundance and
verdure of the country, yet in picturesque effect it is extremely
deficient. Monotony, even of excellence, displeases. I am speaking
of the road which passes through Bolbec and Yvetot: there is
another which lies nearer to the banks of the Seine, through
Lillebonne and Caudebec, and this, I do not doubt, would, in every
point of view, have been preferable.</p>
<p>At but a short distance from Havre, to the left, lies the
church, formerly part of the priory, of Gr&#226;ville, a
picturesque and interesting object. Of the date of its erection we
have no certain knowledge, and it is much to be regretted that we
have not, for it is clearly of Norman architecture; the tower a
very pure specimen of that style, and the end of the north transept
one of the most curious any where to be seen, and apparently; also
one of the most ancient<a name="FNanchor44" id=
"FNanchor44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>. I
should therefore feel no scruple in referring the building to a
more early period than the beginning of the thirteenth century,
where our records of the establishment commence; for it was then
that William Malet, Lord of Gr&#226;ville, placed here a number of
regular canons from Ste. Barbe en Auge, and endowed them with all
the tythes and patronage he possessed in France and England. The
act by which Walter, Archbishop of Rouen, confirmed this
foundation, is dated <a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;84]</span></a>in 1203. <i>Stachys
Germanica</i>, a plant of extreme rarity in England, grows
abundantly here by the road-side; and apple-trees are very
numerous, not only edging the road, but planted in rows across the
fields.</p>
<p>The valley by which you enter Bolbec is pretty and varied; full
of trees and houses, which stand at different heights upon the
hills on either side. The town itself is long, straggling, and
uneven. Through it runs a rapid little stream, which serves many
purposes of extensive business, connected with the cotton
manufactory, the preparation of leather, cutlery, &amp;c. This
stream, of the same name with the town, afterwards falls into the
Seine, near Lillebonne, one of the most ancient places in Normandy,
and formerly the metropolis of the Caletes, but now only a wretched
village. Tradition refers its ruin to the period of the invasion of
Gaul by the Romans; but it revived under the Norman Dukes, who
resided here a portion of the year, and it was a favorite seat of
William the Conqueror. To him, or to one of his immediate
predecessors or successors, it is most probable that the castle
owes its existence. Mr. Cotman found the ruins of it extensive and
remarkable. The importance of the place, at a far more early date,
is proved by the medals of the Upper and Lower Empire, which are
frequently dug up here, and not less decisively by the many Roman
roads which originate from the town. Bolbec can lay claim to no
similar distinction; but it is full of industrious manufacturers.
Twice in the last century it was burned to the ground; and, after
each conflagration, it has arisen more flourishing from its ashes.
At the last, which happened in 1765, Louis XVth made <a name=
"Page_85" id="Page_85"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;85]</span></a>a donation to the town of eighty
thousand livres, and the parliament of Normandy added a gratuity of
half as much more, to assist the inhabitants in repairing their
losses.</p>
<p>Yvetot, the next stage, possesses no visible interest, and
furnishes no employment for the pencil. The town is, like Bolbec, a
residence for manufacturers; and the curious stranger would seek in
vain for any traces of decayed magnificence, any vestiges or
records of a royal residence. And yet, it is held that Yvetot was
the capital of a <i>kingdom</i>, which, if it really did exist, had
certainly the distinction of being the smallest that ever was ruled
on its own account. The subject has much exercised the talents and
ingenuity of historians. It has been maintained by the affirmants,
that an actual monarchy existed here at a period as remote as the
sixth century; others argue that, though the Lords of Yvetot may
have been stiled <i>Kings</i>, the distinction was merely titular,
and was not conferred till about the year 1400; whilst a third,
and, perhaps, most numerous, body, treat the whole as
apocryphal.</p>
<p>Robert Gaguin<a name="FNanchor45" id="FNanchor45"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>, a French historian of the
fifteenth century, prefaces the anecdote by observing, that he is
the <a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;86]</span></a>first French writer by whom it
is recorded; and, as if sensible that such a remark could not fail
to excite suspicion, he proceeds to say, that it is wonderful that
his predecessors should have been silent. Yet he certainly was not
the first who stated the story in print; for it appears in the
Chronicles of Nicholas Gilles, which were printed in 1492, whilst
the earliest edition of Gaugin was published in
1497.&#8212;According to these monkish historians, Clotharius, of
France, son of Clovis, had threatened the life of his chamberlain,
Gaultier, Lord of Yvetot, who thereupon fled the kingdom, and for
ten years remained in voluntary <a name="Page_87" id=
"Page_87"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;87]</span></a>exile,
fighting against the infidels. At the end of this period, Gaultier
hoped that the anger of his sovereign might be appeased, and he
accordingly went to Rome, and implored the aid of the Supreme
Pontiff. Pope Agapetus pitied the wanderer; and he gave unto him a
letter addressed to the King of the Franks, in which he interceded
for the supplicant. Clotharius was then residing at Soissons, his
capital, and thither Gaultier repaired on Good-Friday, in the year
536, and, availing himself of the moment when the King was kneeling
before the altar, threw himself at the feet of the royal votary,
beseeching pardon in the name of the common Savior of mankind, who
on that day shed his blood for the redemption of the human race.
But his prayers and appeal were in vain: he found no pardon;
Clothair drew his sword, and slew him on the spot. The Pope
threatened the monarch with apostolical vengeance, and Clothair
attempted to atone for the murder, by raising the town and
territory of Yvetot into a kingdom, and granting it in perpetuity
to the heirs of Gaultier.</p>
<p>Such is the tradition. There is a very able dissertation upon
the subject, by the Abb&#233; de Vertot<a name="FNanchor46" id=
"FNanchor46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>, who
endeavors to disprove the whole story: first by the silence of all
contemporary authors; then by the fact, that Yvetot was not at that
time under the dominion of Clothair; then <a name="Page_88" id=
"Page_88"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;88]</span></a>by an
anachronism, which the story involves as to Pope Agapetus; and
finally by sundry other arguments of minor importance. Even he,
however, admits, that in a royal decree, dated 1392, and preserved
among the records of the Exchequer of Normandy, the title of
<i>King</i> is given to the Lord of Yvetot; and he is obliged to
cut the knot, which he is unable to untie, by stating it as his
opinion, that at or about this period Yvetot was really raised into
a sovereignty, though, on what occasion, for what purpose, and with
what privileges, no document remains to prove. As a parallel case,
he instances the Peers of France, an order with whose existence
every body is acquainted, while of the date of the establishment
nothing is known. It is surprising, that so clear-sighted a writer
did not perceive that he was doing nothing more than illustrating,
as the logicians say, <i>obscurum per obscurius</i>, or, rather,
making darkness more dark; as if it were not considerably more
probable, that so strange a circumstance should have taken place in
the sixth century, and have been left unrecorded, when society was
unformed, anomalies frequent, and historians few, than that it
should have happened in the fourteenth, a period when the
government of France was completely settled in a regular form,
under one monarch, when literature was generally diffused, and when
every remarkable event was chronicled. Besides which, the
inhabitants of the little kingdom continued, in some measure,
independent of his Most Christian Majesty, even until the
revolution. At least, they paid not a sou of taxes, neither
<i>aides</i>, nor <i>tenth-penny</i>, nor <i>gabelle</i>. It was a
sanctuary into which no <a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;89]</span></a>farmer of the revenue dared to
enter. And it is hardly to be doubted, but that there must have
been some very singular cause for so singular and enviable a
privilege. In our own days, M. Duputel<a name="FNanchor47" id=
"FNanchor47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>, a
member of the academy of Rouen, has entered the lists against the
Abb&#233;; and between them the matter is still undecided, and is
likely so to continue. For myself, I have no means of throwing
light upon it; but the impression left upon my mind, after reading
both sides of the question, is, that the arguments are altogether
in favor of Vertot, while the greater weight of probabilities is in
the opposite scale. I shall leave you, however, to poise the
balance, and I shall not attempt to cause either end of the beam to
preponderate, by acting the part of Old Nick as before exhibited to
you; though I decidedly believe that Gaguin had some authority for
his tale, but, by neglecting to quote it, he has left the minds of
his readers to uncertainty, and his own veracity to suspicion.</p>
<p>With this digression I bid farewell to Yvetot, and its
Lilliputian kingdom; nor will I detain you much longer on the way
to Rouen, the road passing through nothing likely to afford
interest in point of historical recollection or antiquities; though
within a very short distance of the ancient Abbey of Pavilly on the
one side, and at no great distance from the still more celebrated
Monastery of Jumieges on the other. The houses in this neighborhood
are in general composed of a framework of wood, with the
interstices filled with clay, in which are imbedded small pieces of
glass, disposed in <a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;90]</span></a>rows, for windows. The wooden
studs are preserved from the weather by slates, laid one over the
other, like the scales of a fish, along their whole surface, or
occasionally by wood over wood in the same manner. I am told that
there are some very ancient timber churches in Norway, erected
immediately after the conversion of the Northmen, which are covered
with wood-scales: the coincidence is probably accidental, yet it is
not altogether unworthy of notice. At one end the roof projects
beyond the gable four or five feet, in order to protect a door-way
and ladder or staircase that leads to it; and this elevation has a
very picturesque effect. A series of villages, composed of cottages
of this description, mixed with large manufactories and extensive
bleaching grounds, comprise all that is to be remarked in the
remainder of the ride; a journey that would be as interesting to a
traveller in quest of statistical information, as it would be the
contrary to you or to me.</p>
<p>Poverty, the inseparable companion of a manufacturing
population, shews itself in the number of beggars that infest this
road as well as that from Calais to Paris. They station themselves
by the side of every hill, as regularly as the mendicants of Rome
were wont to do upon the bridges. Sometimes a small nosegay thrown
into your carriage announces the petition in language, which,
though mute, is more likely to prove efficacious than the loudest
prayer. Most commonly, however, there is no lack of words; and,
after a plaintive voice has repeatedly assailed you with "une
petite charit&#233;, s'il vous plait, Messieurs et Dames," an
appeal is generally <a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;91]</span></a>made to your devotion, by their
gabbling over the Lord's Prayer and the Creed with the greatest
possible velocity. At the conclusion, I have often been told that
they have repeated them once, and will do so a second time if I
desire it! Should all this prove ineffectual, you will not fail to
hear "allons, Messieurs et Dames, pour l'amour de Dieu, qu'il vous
donn&#233; un bon voyage," or probably a song or two; the whole
interlarded with scraps of prayers, and ave-marias, and promises to
secure you "sant&#233; et salut." They go through it with an
earnestness and pertinacity almost inconceivable, whatever rebuffs
they may receive. Their good temper, too, is undisturbed, and their
face is generally as piteous as their language and tone; though
every now and then a laugh will out, and probably at the very
moment when they are telling you they are "pauvres petits
mis&#233;rables," or "petits malheureux, qui n'ont ni p&#232;re ni
m&#232;re." With all this they are excellent flatterers. An
Englishman is sure to be "milord," and a lady to be "ma belle
duchesse," or "ma belle princesse." They will try too to please you
by "vivent les Anglais, vive Louis dix-huit." In 1814 and 1815, I
remember the cry used commonly to be "vive Napol&#233;on," but they
have now learned better; and, in truth, they had no reason to bear
attachment to the ex-emperor, an early maxim of whose policy it was
to rid the face of the country of this description of persons, for
which purpose he established workhouses, or <i>d&#233;pots de
mendicit&#233;</i>, in each department, and his gendarmes were
directed to proceed in the most summary manner, by conveying every
mendicant and vagrant <a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;92]</span></a>to these receptacles, without
listening to any excuse, or granting any delay. He had no clear
idea of the necessity of the gentle formalities of a summons, and a
pass under his worship's hand and seal. And, without entering into
the elaborate researches respecting the original habitat of a
<i>mumper</i>, which are required by the English law, he thought
that pauperism could be sufficiently protected by consigning the
specimen to the nearest cabinet. The simple and rigorous plan of
Napol&#233;on was conformable to the nature of his government, and
it effectually answered the purpose. The day, therefore, of his
exile to Elba was a <i>Beggar's Opera</i> throughout France; and
they have kept up the jubilee to the present hour, and seem likely
to persist in maintaining it.</p>

<h2>LETTER VII.</h2>
<h4>ON THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN FRANCE.</h4>
<p class="r">(<i>Rouen, June</i>, 1818.)</p>
<p>Abandoning, for the present, all discussion of the themes of the
elder day, I shall occupy myself with matters relating to the
living world. The fatigued and hungry traveller, whose flesh is
weaker than his spirit, is often too apt to think that his bed and
his supper are of more immediate consequence than churches or
castles. And to those who are in this predicament, there is a
material improvement at Rouen, since I was last here: nothing could
be worse than the inns of the year 1815; but four years of peace
have effected a wonderful alteration, and nothing can now be better
than the H&#244;tel de Normandie, where we have fixed our quarters.
Objection may, indeed, be made to its situation, as to that of
every other h&#244;tel in the city; but this is of little moment in
a town, where every house, whatever street or place it may front,
opens into a court-yard, so that its views are confined to what
passes within its own quadrangle; and, for excellence of
accommodations, elegance of furniture, skill in cookery, civility
of attendance, nay, even for what is more rare, neatness, our host,
M. Trimolet, may challenge competition with almost any
establishment in Europe. For the rent of the house, which is one of
the most spacious in Rouen, he pays three thousand francs a year;
and, as house-rent is one <a name="Page_94" id=
"Page_94"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;94]</span></a>of the
main standards of the value of the circulating medium, I will add,
that our friend, M. Rondeau, for his, which is not only among the
largest but among the most elegant and the best placed for
business, pays but five hundred francs more. This, then, may be
considered as the <i>maximum</i> at Rouen. Yet Rouen is far from
being the place which should be selected by an Englishman, who
retires to France for the purpose of economizing: living in general
is scarcely one-fourth cheaper than in our own country. At Caen it
is considerably more reasonable; on the banks of the Loire the
expences of a family do not amount to one-half of the English cost;
and still farther south a yet more sensible reduction takes place,
the necessaries of life being cheaper by half than they are in
Normandy, and house-rent by full four-fifths.</p>
<p>A foreigner can glean but little useful information respecting
the actual state of a country through which he journeys with as
much rapidity as I have done. And still less is he able to secern
the truth from the falsehood, or to weigh the probabilities of
conflicting testimony. I therefore originally intended to be silent
on this subject. There is a story told, I believe, of Voltaire, at
least it may be as well told of Voltaire as of any other wit, that,
being once in company with a very talkative empty Frenchman, and a
very <i>glum</i> and silent Englishman, he afterwards characterized
them by saying, "l'un ne dit que des riens, et l'autre ne dit
rien." Fearing that my political and statistical observations,
which in good truth are very slender, might be ranked but too truly
in the former category, I had resolved to confine them to my own
notebook. <a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;95]</span></a>Yet we all take so much interest
in the destinies of our ancient rival and enemy, (I wish I could
add, our modern friend,) that, according to my usual habit, I
changed my determination within a minute after I had formed it; for
I yielded to the impression, that even my scanty contribution would
not be wholly unacceptable to you.</p>
<p>France, I am assured on all sides, is rapidly improving, and the
government is satisfactory to all <i>liberal</i> men, in which
number I include persons of every opinion, except the emigrants and
those attached exclusively to the <i>ancien r&#233;gime</i>. Men of
the latter description are commonly known by the name of
<i>Ultras</i>; and, speaking with a degree of freedom, which is
practised here, to at least as great an extent as in England, they
do not hesitate to express their decided disapprobation of the
present system of government, and to declare, not only that
Napol&#233;on was more of a royalist than Louis, but that the King
is a jacobin. They persuade themselves also, and would fain
persuade others, that he is generally hated; and their doctrine is,
that the nation is divided into three parties, ready to tear each
other in pieces: the <i>Ministerialists</i>, who are few, and in
every respect contemptible; the <i>Ultras</i>, not numerous, but
headed by the Princes, and thus far of weight; and the
<i>Revolutionists</i>, who, in point of numbers, as well as of
talents and of opulence, considerably exceed the other two, and
will, probably, ultimately prevail; so that these conflicts of
opinion will terminate by decomposing the constitutional monarchy
into a republic. To listen to these men, you might almost fancy
they were quoting from Clarendon's History of the Rebellion in
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;96]</span></a>our own country; so entirely do
their feelings coincide with those of the courtiers who attended
Charles in his exile. Similar too is the reward they receive; for
it is difficult for a monarch to be just, however he may in some
cases he generous.</p>
<p>Yet even the Ultras admit that the revolution has been
beneficial to France, though they are willing to confine its
benefits to the establishment of the trial by jury, and the
correction of certain abuses connected with the old system of
nobility. Among the advantages obtained, they include the abolition
of the game laws; and, indeed, I am persuaded, from all I hear,
that this much-contested question could not receive a better
solution than by appealing to the present laws in France. Game is
here altogether the property of the land-owner; it is freely
exposed for sale, like other articles of food; and every one is
himself at liberty to sport, or to authorize his friend to do so
over his property, with no other restriction than that of taking
out a licence, or <i>port d'armes</i>, which, for fifteen francs,
is granted without difficulty to any man of respectability,
whatever may be his condition in life. In this particular, I cannot
but think that France has set us an example well worthy of our
imitation; and she also shews that it may be followed without
danger; for neither do the pleasures of the field lose their
relish, nor is the game extirpated. The former are a subject of
conversation in almost every company; and, as to the latter,
whatever slaughter may have taken place in the woods and preserves,
at the first burst of the revolution, I am assured that a good
sportsman may, at the present time, between Dieppe and Rouen
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;97]</span></a>kill with ease, in a day, fifty
head of game, consisting principally of hares, quails, and
partridges.</p>
<p>But, while these men thus restrict the benefits derived from the
revolution, the case is far different with individuals of the other
parties, all of whom are loud and unanimous in its praises. The
good resulting from the republic has been purchased at a dreadful
price, but the good remains; and those, who now enjoy the boon, are
not inclined to remember the blood which drenched the three-colored
banner. Thirty years have elapsed, and a new generation has arisen,
to whom the horrors of the revolution live only in the page of
history. But its advantages are daily felt in the equal nature and
equal administration of the laws; in the suppression of the
monasteries with their concomitant evils; in the restriction of the
powers of the clergy; in the liberty afforded to all modes of
religious worship; and in the abolition of all the edicts and
mandates and prejudices, which secured to a peculiar sect and caste
a monopoly of all the honors and distinctions of the common-wealth;
for now, every individual of talent and character feels that the
path to preferment and power is not obstructed by his birth or his
opinions.</p>
<p>The constitutional charter, in its present state, is a subject
of pride to the French, and a sure bulwark to the throne. The
representative system is beginning to be generally appreciated, and
particularly in commercial towns. The deputies of this department
are to be changed the approaching autumn, and the minds of men are
already anxiously bent upon selecting such representatives as
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;98]</span></a>may best understand and promote
their local interests. Few acts of the Bourbon government have
contributed more powerfully to promote the popularity of the King,
than the law enacted in the course of last year, which abolished
the double election, and enabled the voters to give their suffrages
directly for their favorite candidate, thus putting a stop at once
to a variety of unfair influence, previously exerted upon such
occasions. The same law has also created a general interest upon
the subject, never before known; the strongest proof of which is,
that, of the six or eight thousand electors contained in this
department, nearly the whole are expected now to vote, whereas not
a third ever did so before. The qualifications for an elector and a
deputy are uniform throughout the kingdom, and depending upon few
requisites; nothing more being required in the former case, than
the payment of three hundred francs per annum, in direct taxes, and
the having attained the age of thirty; while an addition of ten
years to the age, and the payment of one thousand francs, instead
of three hundred, renders every individual qualified to be of the
number of the elected. The system, however, is subject to a
restriction, which provides, that at least one half of the
representatives of each department shall be chosen from among those
who reside in it.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the revolution, a much wider door was open:
all that was then necessary to entitle a man to vote, was, that he
should be twenty-one years of age, a Frenchman, and one who had
lived for a year in the country on his own revenue, or on the
produce <a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;99]</span></a>of his labor, and was not in a
state of servitude. It was then also decreed, that the electors
should have each three livres a day during their mission, and
should be allowed at the rate of one livre a league, for the
distance from their usual place of residence, to that in which the
election of members for their department is held. Such were the
only conditions requisite for eligibility, either as elector or
deputy; except, indeed, that the citizens in the primary
assemblies, and the electors in the electoral assembly, swore that
they would maintain liberty and equality, or die rather than
violate their oath<a name="FNanchor48" id="FNanchor48"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The wisdom and prudence of the subsequent alterations, few will
be disposed to question: the system, in its present state, appears
to me admirably qualified to attain the object in view; and such
seems the general character of the French <i>Constitutional
Charter</i>, which unites two excellent qualities, great clearness
and great brevity. The whole is comprised in seventy-four short
articles; and, that no Frenchman may plead ignorance of his rights
or his duties, it is usually found prefixed to the almanacks. Some
persons might, indeed, be inclined to deem this station as ominous;
for, since the revolution began, the frame of the French government
has sustained so many alterations, that, considering that several
of their constitutions never outlived the current quarter, they may
be fairly said to have had a new constitution in each year. How far
the Bourbon charter will answer the purpose of serving as the basis
of a code of laws for the government of an extensive <a name=
"Page_100" id="Page_100"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;100]</span></a>kingdom, time only can
determine. At present, it has the charm of novelty to recommend it;
and there are few among us with whom novelty is not a strong
attraction. Our friends on this side of the water are greatly
belied, if it be not so with them.</p>
<p>The finances of the French municipalities are administered with
a degree of fairness and attention, which might put many a body
corporate, in a certain island, to the blush. Little is known in
England respecting the administration of the French towns: the
following particulars relating to the revenue and expences of
Rouen, may, therefore, in some measure, serve as a scale, by which
you may give a guess at the balance-sheet of cities of greater or
lesser magnitude.&#8212;The budget amounted for the last year to
one million two hundred thousand francs. The proposed items of
expenditure must be particularized, and submitted to the Prefect
and the Minister of the Interior, before they can be paid. In this
sum is comprised the charge for the hospitals, which contain above
three thousand persons, including foundlings, and for all the other
public institutions, the number and excellence of which has long
been the pride of Rouen. You must consider too, that every thing of
this kind is, in France, national: individuals do nothing, neither
is it expected of them; and herein consists one of the most
essential differences between France and England. To meet this
great expenditure, the city is provided with the rents of public
lands, with wharfage, with tolls from the markets and the
<i>halles</i>; and, above all, with the <i>octroi</i>, a tax that
prevails through France, upon every article of consumption <a name=
"Page_101" id="Page_101"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;101]</span></a>brought into the towns, and is
collected at the barriers. The <i>octroi</i>, like turnpike-tolls
or the post-horse duty with us, is farmed; two-thirds are received
by the government, and the remaining one-third by the town. In
Rouen it produced the last year one million four hundred and fifty
thousand francs.&#8212;If, now, this sum appears to you
comparatively greater than that of our large cities in England, you
must recollect that, with us, towns are not liable to similar
charges: our corporations support no museums, no academies, no
learned bodies; and our infirmaries, and dispensaries, and
hospitals, are indebted, as well for their existence as their
future maintenance, to the piety of the dead, or the liberality of
the living. Nor must we forget that, even in this great kingdom,
Rouen, at present, holds the fifth place among the towns; though it
was far from being thus, when Buonapart&#233;, uniting the imperial
to the iron crown, overshadowed with his eagle-wings the continent
from the Baltic to Apulia; and when the mural crowns of Rome and
Amsterdam stood beneath the shield of the "good city" of Paris.</p>
<p>The population of Rouen is estimated at eighty-seven thousand
persons, of whom the greater number are engaged in the
manufactories, which consist principally of cotton, linen, and
woollen cloths, and are among the largest in France. At present,
however, "trade is dull;" and hence, and as the politics of a
trader invariably sympathize with his cash account, neither the
peace, nor the English, nor the princes of the Bourbon dynasty, are
popular here; for the articles manufactured at Rouen, being
designed generally for exportation, ranged almost unrivalled over
the continent, during the war, but now in every town they <a name=
"Page_102" id="Page_102"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;102]</span></a>meet with competitors in the
goods from England, which are at once of superior workmanship and
cheaper. The latter advantage is owing very much to the greater
perfection of our machinery, and, perhaps, still more to the
abundance of coals, which enables us, at so small an expence, to
keep our steam-engines in action, and thus to counterbalance the
disproportion in the charge of manual labor, as well as the many
disadvantages arising from the pressure of our heavy
taxation.&#8212;But I must cease. An English fit of growling is
coming upon me; and I find that the Blue Devils, which haunt St.
Stephen's chapel, are pursuing me over the channel.</p>

<p class="r">(<i>Rouen, June,</i> 1818)</p>
<p>My researches in this city after the remains of architectural
antiquity of the earlier Norman &#230;ra, have hitherto, I own,
been attended with little success. I may even go so far as to say,
that I have seen nothing in the circular style, for which it would
not be easy to find a parallel in most of the large towns in
England. On the other hand, the perfection and beauty of the
specimens of the pointed style, have equally surprised and
delighted me. I will endeavor, however, to take each object in its
order, premising that I have been materially assisted in my
investigations by M. Le Prevost and M. Rondeau, but especially by
the former, one of the most learned antiquaries of Normandy.</p>
<p>Of the fortifications and castellated buildings in Rouen very
little indeed is left<a name="FNanchor49" id=
"FNanchor49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>, and
that little is altogether insignificant; being confined to some
fragments of the walls scattered here and there<a name="FNanchor50"
id="FNanchor50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a>, and
to three circular towers of the plainest construction, the remains
of the old castle, <a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;104]</span></a>built by Philip Augustus in
1204, near to the Porte Bouvreuil, and hence commonly known by the
name of the <i>Ch&#226;teau de Bouvreuil</i> or <i>le Vieux
Ch&#226;teau</i>.&#8212;It is to the leading part which this city
has acted in the history of France, that we must attribute the
repeated erection and demolition of its fortifications.</p>
<p>An important event was commemorated by the erection of the
<i>old castle</i>, it having been built upon the final annexation
of Normandy to the crown of France, in consequence of the weakness
of our ill-starred monarch,&#8212;John Lackland. The French King
seems to have suspected that the citizens retained their fealty to
their former sovereign. He intended that his fortress should
command and bridle the city, instead of defending it. The
town-walls were razed, and the <i>Vieille Tour</i>, the ancient
palace of the Norman Dukes, levelled with the ground.&#8212;But, as
the poet says of language, so it is with castles,&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">... "mortalia facta peribunt,</p>
<p class="i1">Nec <i>castellorum</i> stet honos et gratia
vivax;"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and, in 1590, the fortress raised by Philip Augustus experienced
the fate of its predecessors; it was then ruined and dismantled,
and the portion which was allowed to stand, was degraded into a
jail. Now the three<a name="FNanchor51" id=
"FNanchor51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> towers
just mentioned are alone remaining, and these would attract little
notice, were it not that one of them bears the name of the <i>Tour
de la Pucelle</i>, as having been, <a name="Page_105" id=
"Page_105"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;105]</span></a>in 1430,
the place of confinement of the unfortunate Joan of Arc, when she
was captured before Compi&#233;gne and brought prisoner to
Rouen.</p>
<p>It must be stated, however, that the first castle recorded to
have existed at Rouen, was built by Rollo, shortly after he had
made himself master of Neustria. Its very name is now lost; and all
we know concerning it is, that it stood near the quay, at the
northern extremity of the town, in the situation subsequently
occupied by the Church of St. Pierre du Ch&#226;tel, and the
adjoining monastery of the Cordeliers.</p>
<p>After a lapse of less than fifty years, Rouen saw rising within
her walls a second castle, the work of Duke Richard Ist, and long
the residence of the Norman sovereigns. This, from a tower of great
strength which formed a part of it, and which was not demolished
till the year 1204, acquired the appellation of <i>la Vieille
Tour</i>; and the name remains to this day, though the building has
disappeared.</p>
<p>The space formerly occupied by the scite of it is now covered by
the <i>halles</i>, considered the finest in France. The historians
of Rouen, in the usual strain of hyperbole, hint that their
<i>halles</i> are even the finest in the world<a name="FNanchor52"
id="FNanchor52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>,
though they are very inferior to their prototypes at Bruges and
Ypres. The hall, or exchange, allotted to the mercers, is two
hundred and seventy-two feet in length, by fifty feet wide: those
for the drapers and for wool are, each of them, two hundred feet
long; and all these are surpassed in size by the corn-hall, whose
length extends to three hundred feet. They are built round a large
square, the centre of which is occupied by numberless dealers in
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;106]</span></a>pottery, old clothes, &amp;c.;
and, as the day on which we chanced to visit them was a Friday,
when alone they are opened for public business, we found a most
lively, curious, and interesting scene.</p>
<p>It was on the top of a stone staircase, the present entry to the
<i>halles</i>, that the annual ceremony<a name="FNanchor53" id=
"FNanchor53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> of
delivering and pardoning a criminal for the sake of St. Romain, the
tutelary protector of Rouen, was performed on Ascension-day,
according to a privilege exercised, from time immemorial, by the
Chapter of the Cathedral.</p>
<p>The legend is romantic; and it acquires a species of historical
importance, as it became the foundation of a right, asserted even
in our own days. My account of it is taken from Dom Pommeraye's
History of the Life of the Prelate<a name="FNanchor54" id=
"FNanchor54"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a>.&#8212;He has been relating many
miracles performed <a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;107]</span></a>by him, and, among others, that
of causing the Seine, at the time of a great inundation, to retire
to its channel by his command, agreeably to the following beautiful
stanza of Santeuil:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Tangit exundans aqua civitatem;</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Voce Romanus jubet efficaci;</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Audiunt fluctus, docilisque cedit</p>
<p class="i5">&#160;Unda jubenti."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Our learned Benedictine thus proceeds:&#8212;"But the following
miracle was deemed a far greater marvel, and <a name="Page_108" id=
"Page_108"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;108]</span></a>it
increased the veneration of the people towards St. Romain to such a
degree, that they henceforth regarded him as an actual apostle,
who, from the authority of his office, the excellence of his
doctrine, his extreme sanctity, and the gift of miracles, deserved
to be classed with the earliest preachers of our holy faith. In a
marshy spot, near Rouen, was bred a dragon, the very counterpart of
that destroyed by St. Nicaise. It committed frightful ravages; lay
in wait for man and beast, whom it devoured without mercy; the air
was poisoned by its pestilential breath, and it was alone the cause
of greater mischief and alarm, than could have been occasioned by a
whole army of enemies. The inhabitants, wearied out by many years
of suffering, implored the aid of St. Romain; and the charitable
and generous pastor, who dreaded nothing in behalf of his flock,
comforted them with the assurance of a speedy deliverance. The
design itself was noble; still more so was the manner by which he
put it in force; for he would not be satisfied with merely killing
the monster, but undertook also to bring it to public execution, by
way of atonement for its cruelties. For this purpose, it was
necessary that the dragon should be caught; but when the prelate
required a companion in the attempt, the hearts of all men failed
them. He applied, therefore, to a criminal condemned to death for
murder; and, by the promise of a pardon, bought his assistance,
which the certain prospect of a scaffold, had he refused to
accompany the saint, caused him the more willingly to lend.
Together they went, and had no sooner reached the marsh, the
monster's haunt, than St. Romain, approaching <a name="Page_109"
id="Page_109"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;109]</span></a>courageously, made the sign of
the cross, and at once put it out of the power of the dragon to
attempt to do him injury. He then tied his stole around his neck,
and, in that state, delivered him to the prisoner, who dragged him
to the city, where he was burned in the presence of all the people,
and his ashes thrown into the river.&#8212;The manuscript of the
Abbey of Hautmont, from which this legend is extracted, adds, that
such was the fame of this miracle throughout France, that Dagobert,
the reigning sovereign, sent for St. Romain to court, to hear a
true narrative of the fact from his own lips; and, impressed with
reverent awe, bestowed the celebrated privilege upon him and his
successors for ever."</p>
<p>The right has, in comparatively modern times, been more than
once contested, but always maintained; and so great was the
celebrity of the ceremony, that princes and potentates have
repeatedly travelled to Rouen, for the purpose of witnessing it.
There are not wanting, however, those<a name="FNanchor55" id=
"FNanchor55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> who
treat the whole story as allegorical, and believe it to be nothing
more than a symbolical representation of the subversion of
idolatry, or of the confining of the Seine to its channel; the
winding course of the river being typified by a serpent, and the
word <i>Gargouille</i> corrupted from <i>gurges</i>. Other writers
differ in minor points of the story, and alledge that the saint had
two fellow adventurers, a thief as well as a murderer, and that the
former ran away, while the latter stood firm. You will see it thus
figured in a modern painting on St. Romain's altar, in the
cathedral; and there are two persons also with him, in the only
ancient representation of the subject I am acquainted <a name=
"Page_110" id="Page_110"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;110]</span></a>with, a bas-relief which till
lately existed at the Porte Bouvreuil, and of which, by the
kindness of M. Riaux, I am enabled to send you a drawing.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_10" id="plate_10"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_10.png" height="417" width="367" alt=
"Bas-Relief, representing St. Romain" /></p>
<p>To keep alive the tradition, in which Popish superstition has
contrived to blend Judaic customs with heathen mythology, the
practice was, that the prisoner selected for pardon should be
brought to this place, called the chapel of St. Romain, and should
here be received by the clergy in full robes, headed by the
archbishop, and bearing all the relics of the church; among others,
the shrine of St. Romain, which the criminal, after having been
reprimanded and absolved, but still kneeling, thrice lifted, among
the shouts of the populace, and then, with a garland upon his head
and the shrine in his hands, accompanied the clergy in procession
to the cathedral<a name="FNanchor56" id="FNanchor56"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a>.&#8212;But the revolution
happily consigned the relics to their kindred dust, and put an end
to a privilege eminently liable to abuse, from the circumstance of
the pardon being extended, not only to the criminal himself, but to
all his accomplices; so that, an inferior culprit sometimes
surrendered himself to justice, in confidence of interest being
made to obtain him the shrine, and thus to shield under his
protection more powerful and more guilty delinquents. The various
modifications, however, of latter times, had so abridged its power,
that it was at last only able to rescue a man guilty of involuntary
homicide<a name="FNanchor57" id="FNanchor57"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a>. We may hope, therefore, it was
not altogether <a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;111]</span></a>deserving the hard terms
bestowed upon it by Millin<a name="FNanchor58" id=
"FNanchor58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> who
calls it the most absurd, most infamous, and most detestable of all
privileges, and adduces a very flagrant instance of injustice
committed under its plea.&#8212;D'Al&#233;gre, governor of Gisors,
in consequence of a private pique against the Baron du Hallot, lord
of the neighboring town of Vernon, treacherously assassinated him
at his own house, while he was yet upon crutches, in consequence of
the wounds received at the siege of Rouen. This happened during the
civil wars; in the course of which, Hallot had signalized himself
as a faithful servant, and useful assistant to the monarch. The
murderer knew that there were no hopes for him of royal mercy; and,
after having passed some time in concealment and as a soldier in
the army of the league, he had recourse to the Chapter of the
Cathedral of Rouen, from whom he obtained the promise of the shrine
of St. Romain. To put full confidence, however, even in this,
would, under such circumstances, have been imprudent. The clergy
might break their word, or a mightier power might interpose.
D'Al&#233;gre, therefore, persuaded a young mam, formerly a page of
his, of the name of Pehu, to surrender himself as guilty of the
crime; and to him the privilege was granted; under the sanction of
which, the real culprit, and several of his accomplices in the
assassination, obtained a free pardon. The widow and daughter of
Hallot, in vain remonstrated: the utmost that could be done, after
a tedious law-suit, was to procure a small fine to be imposed upon
Pehu, and to cause him to be banished from Normandy and Picardy and
the vicinity of Paris. But <a name="Page_112" id=
"Page_112"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;112]</span></a>regulations were in consequence
adopted with respect to the exercise of the privilege; and the
pardons granted under favor of it were ever afterwards obliged to
be ratified under the high seal of the kingdom.</p>
<p>The <i>Ch&#226;teau du Vieux Palais</i> and <i>le petit
Ch&#226;teau</i> like the edifices which I have already noticed,
have equally yielded to time and violence. M. Carpentier has
furnished us with representations of both these castles, drawn and
etched by himself, in the <i>Itinerary of Rouen</i>. The first of
them has also been inaccurately figured by Ducarel, and
satisfactorily by Millin, in the second volume of his
<i>Antiquit&#233;s Nationales</i>; where, to the pen of this most
meritorious and indefatigable writer, of whom, as of our Goldsmith,
it may be justly said, that "nullum fer&#232; scribendi genus non
tetigit, nullum quod tetigit non ornavit," it affords materials for
a curious memoir, blended with the history of our own Henry Vth,
and of Henry IVth, of France. The castle was the work of the first
of these sovereigns, and was begun by him in 1420, two years after
a seven months' siege had put him in possession of the city, long
the capital of his ancestors, and had thus rendered him undisputed
master of Normandy. This was an event worthy of being immortalised;
and it may easily be imagined that private feelings had no little
share in urging him to erect a magnificent palace, intended at once
as a safeguard for the town, and a residence for himself and his
posterity. The right to build it was an express article in the
capitulation he granted to Rouen, a capitulation of extreme
severity<a name="FNanchor59" id="FNanchor59"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>, and purchased at the price of
three hundred thousand golden crowns, as well as of the lives of
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;113]</span></a>three of the most distinguished
citizens; Robert Livret, grand-vicar of the archbishop, John
Jourdain, commander of the artillery, and Louis Blanchard, captain
of the train-bands. The two first of these were, however, suffered
to ransome themselves; the last, a man of distinguished honor and
courage, was beheaded; but Henry, much to his credit, made no
farther use of his victory, and even consented to pay for the
ground required for his castle. He selected for the purpose, the
situation where, defence was most needed, upon the extremity of the
quay, by the side of the river, near the entrance from Dieppe and
Havre. A row of handsome houses now fills the chief part of the
space occupied by the building, which, at a subsequent period, was
again connected with English history<a name="FNanchor60" id=
"FNanchor60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>, as the
residence of our James IInd, after the battle of La Hague; before
his spirit was yet sufficiently broken to suffer him to give up all
thoughts of the British crown, and to accept the asylum offered by
Louis XIVth, in the obscure tranquillity of Saint Germain's. It
continued perfect till the time of the revolution, and was of great
extent and strength, defended by massy circular towers, surrounded
by a moat, and approachable only by a draw-bridge.</p>
<p>The castle, which still remains to be described, and whose
smaller size is sufficiently denoted by its name, was also built by
the same monarch, but it was raised upon the ruins of a similar
edifice that had existed since the days of King John. Being
situated at the foot of the bridge, the older castle had been
selected as the spot where it was stipulated that the soldiers,
composing the <a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;114]</span></a>Anglo-Norman garrison, should
lay down their arms, when the town surrendered to Philip
Augustus.&#8212;It was known from very early time by the
appellation of the <i>Barbican</i>, a term of much disputed
signification as well as origin: if we are to conclude, according
to some authorities, that it denoted either a mere breast-work, or
a watch-tower, or an appendage to a more important fortress, it
would appear but ill applied to a building like the one in
question. I should rather believe it designated an out-post of any
kind; and I would support my conjecture by this very castle, which
was neither upon elevated ground, nor dependent on any other. It
consisted of two square edifices, similar to what are called the
<i>pavillions</i> of the Thuilleries, flanked by small circular
towers with conical roofs, and connected by an embattled wall. Not
more than fifty years have passed since its demolition; yet no
traces of it are to be found.</p>
<p>A few rocky fragments, appearing now to bid defiance to time,
indicate the scite of the fortress, which once arose on the summit
of Mont Ste. Catherine, and which, though dismantled by Henry IVth,
and reduced to a state of dilapidation, was still suffered to
maintain its ruined existence till a few years ago. Its commanding
situation, upon an eminence three hundred and eighty feet high and
immediately overhanging the city, could not but render it of great
importance towards the defence of the place; and we accordingly
find that Taillepied, who probably wrote before its demolition,
gives it as his opinion, that whoever is in possession of Mont Ste.
Catherine, is also master of the town, if he can but have abundant
supplies of water and provisions;&#8212;no needless stipulation!
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;115]</span></a>At the same time, it must be
admitted that the fort was equally liable to be converted into the
means of annoyance. Such actually proved the case in 1562, at which
time it was seized by the Huguenots; and considerations of this
nature most probably prevailed with the citizens, when they
declined the offer made by Francis Ist, who proposed at a public
meeting to enlarge the tower into an impregnable citadel. In the
hands of the Protestants, the fortress, such as it was, proved
sufficient to resist the whole army of Charles IXth, during several
days.&#8212;Rouen was stoutly defended by the reformed, well aware
of the sanguinary dispositions of the bigotted monarch. They
yielded, and he sullied his victory by giving the city up to
plunder, during twenty-four hours; and we are told, that it was
upon this occasion he first tasted heretical blood, with which,
five years afterwards, he so cruelly gorged himself on the day of
St. Bartholomew. Catherine of Medicis accompanied him to the siege;
and it is related that she herself led him to the ditches of the
ramparts, in which many of their adversaries had been buried, and
caused the bodies to be dug up in his presence, that he might be
accustomed to look without horror upon the corpse of a
Protestant!</p>
<p>Near the fort stood a priory<a name="FNanchor61" id=
"FNanchor61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a>, whose
foundation is dated as far back as the eleventh century, when
Gosselin, Viscount of Rouen, Lord of Arques and Dieppe, having no
son to inherit his wealth, was induced to dispose of it "to pious
uses," by the persuasions of two monks, who had wandered in
pilgrimage from the monastery of Saint Catherine, on Mount Sinai.
These good men assured <a name="Page_116" id=
"Page_116"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;116]</span></a>him,
that, if he dedicated a church to the martyred daughter of the King
of Alexandria, the stones employed in building it would one day
serve him as so many stepping-stones to heaven. They confirmed him
in his resolution, by presenting him with one of the fingers of
Saint Catherine. To her, therefore, the edifice was made sacred,
and hence it is believed that the hill also took its name. In the
<i>Golden Legend</i>, we find an account of the translation of the
finger to Rouen not wholly reconcileable with this
history.&#8212;According to the veracious authority of James of
Voragine, there were certain monks of Rouen, who journeyed even
until the Arabian mountain. For seven long years did they pray
before the shrine of the Queen Virgin and Martyr, and also did they
implore her to vouchsafe to grant them some token of her favor;
and, at length, one of her fingers suddenly disjointed itself from
the dead hand of the corpse.&#8212;"This gift," as the legend
tells, "they received devoutly, and with it they returned to their
monastery at Rouen."&#8212;Never was a miracle less miraculous; and
it is fortunately now of little consequence to inquire whether the
mouldering relic enriched an older monastery, or assisted in
bestowing sanctity on a rising community. According to the
pseudo-hagiologists, the corpse of Saint Catherine was borne
through the air by angels, and deposited on the summit of Mount
Sinai, on the spot where her church is yet standing. Conforming, as
it were, to the example of the angels, it was usual, in the middle
ages, to erect her religious buildings on an eminence. Various
instances may be given of this practice in England, as well as in
France: such is the case near Winchester, <a name="Page_117" id=
"Page_117"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;117]</span></a>near
Christ-Church, in the Isle of Wight, and in many other places. St.
Michael contested the honor with her; and he likewise has a chapel
here, whose walls are yet standing. Its antiquity was still greater
than that of the neighboring monastery; a charter from Duke Richard
IInd, dated 996, speaking of it as having had existence before his
time, and confirming the donation of it to the Abbey of St. Ouen.
But St. Michael's never rivalled the opulence of Saint Catherine's
priory.&#8212;Gosselin himself, and Emmeline his wife, lay buried
in the church of the latter, which is said to have been large, and
to have resembled in its structure that of St. Georges de
Bocherville: it is also recorded, that it was ornamented with many
beautiful paintings; and loud praises are bestowed upon its fine
peal of bells. The epitaph of the founder speaks of him,
as&#8212;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>It is somewhat remarkable, that there appear to have been only
two other monumental inscriptions in the church, and both of them
in memory of cooks of the convent; a presumptive proof that the
holy fathers were not inattentive to the good things of this world,
in the midst of their concern for those of the next.&#8212;The
first of them was for Stephen de Saumere,&#8212;</p>

<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"><span class=

<p>The fort and the religious buildings all perished nearly at the
same time: the former was destroyed at the request of the
inhabitants, to whom Henry IVth returned on that occasion his
well-known answer, that he "wished for no other fortress than the
hearts of his subjects;" the latter to gratify the avarice of
individuals, who cloked their true designs under the plea that the
buildings might serve as a harbor for the disaffected.</p>
<p>Of the origin of the fort I find no record in history, except
what Noel says<a name="FNanchor62" id="FNanchor62"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a>, that it appears to have been
raised by the English while they were masters of Normandy; but what
I observed of the structure of the walls, in 1815, would induce me
to refer it without much hesitation to the time of the Romans. Its
bricks are of the same form and texture as those used by them; and
they were ranged in alternate courses with flints, as is the case
at Burgh Castle, at Richborough, and other Roman edifices in
England. That the fort was of great size and strength is
sufficiently shewn by the depth, width, and extent of the
entrenchments still left, which, particularly towards the plain,
are immense; and, if credence may be given to common report, in
such matters always apt to exaggerate, the subterraneous passages
indicate a fortress of importance.</p>
<p>It chanced, that I visited the hill on Michaelmas-day, and a
curious proof was afforded me, that, at however low an ebb religion
may be in France, enthusiastic fanaticism is far from extinct. A
man of the lower classes of society was praying before a broken
cross, near St. Michael's Chapel, where, before the revolution, the
monks of St. Ouen <a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;119]</span></a>used annually on this day to
perform mass, and many persons of extraordinary piety were wont to
assemble the first Wednesday of every month to pray and to preach,
in honor of the guardian angels. His manner was earnest in the
extreme; his eyes wandered strangely; his gestures were
extravagant, and tears rolled in profusion down a face, whose every
feature bore the strongest marks of a decided devotee. A shower
which came at the moment compelled us both to seek shelter within
the walls of the chapel, and we soon became social and entered into
conversation. The ruined state of the building was his first and
favorite topic: he lamented its destruction; he mourned over the
state of the times which could countenance such impiety; and
gradually, while he turned over the leaves of the prayer-book in
his hand, he was led to read aloud the hundred and thirty-sixth
psalm, commenting upon every verse as he proceeded, and weeping
more and more bitterly, when he came to the part commemorating the
ruin of Jerusalem, which he applied, naturally enough, to the
captive state of France, smarting as she then was under the iron
rod of Prussia. Of the other allies, including even the Russians,
he owned that there was no complaint to be made: "they conduct
themselves," said he, "agreeably to the maxim of warfare, which
says 'battez-vous contre ceux qui vous opposent; mais ayez
piti&#233; des vaincus.' Not so the Prussians: with them it is
'frappez-&#231;&#224;, frappez-l&#224;, et quand ils entrent dans
quelque endroit, ils disent, il nous faut &#231;&#224;, il nous
faut l&#224;, et ils le prennent d'autorit&#233;.' Cruel
Babylon!"&#8212;"Yet, even admitting all this," we asked, "how can
you reconcile with the spirit of christianity <a name="Page_120"
id="Page_120"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;120]</span></a>the
permission given to the Jews by the psalmist, to 'take up her
little ones and dash them against the stones.'"&#8212;"Ah! you
misunderstand the sense, the psalm does not authorize
cruelty;&#8212;mais, attendez! ce n'est pas ainsi: ces pierres
l&#224; sont Saint Pierre; et heureux celui qui les attachera
&#224; Saint Pierre; qui montrera de l'attachement, de
l'intr&#233;pidit&#233; pour sa religion."&#8212;Then again,
looking at the chapel, with tears and sobs, "how can we expect to
prosper, how to escape these miseries, after having committed such
enormities?"&#8212;His name, he told us, was Jacquemet, and my
companion kindly made a sketch of his face, while I noted down his
words.</p>
<p>This specimen will give you some idea of the extraordinary
influence of the Roman catholic faith over the mind, and of the
curious perversions under which it does not scruple to take
refuge.</p>
<p>Leaving for the present the dusty legends of superstition, I
describe with pleasure my recollections of the glorious prospect
over which the eye ranges from the hill of Saint
Catherine.&#8212;The Seine, broad, winding, and full of islands, is
the principal feature of the landscape. This river is distinguished
by its sinuosity and the number of islets which it embraces, and it
retains this character even to Paris. Its smooth tranquillity well
contrasts with the life that is imparted to the scene, by the
shipping and the bustle of the quays. The city itself, with its
verdant walks, its spacious manufactories, its strange and
picturesque buildings, and the numerous spires and towers of its
churches, many of them in ruins, but not the less interesting on
account of their decay, presents a foreground <a name="Page_121"
id="Page_121"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;121]</span></a>diversified with endless
variety of form and color. The bridge of boats seems immediately at
our feet; the middle distance is composed of a plain, chiefly
consisting of the richest meadows, interspersed copiously with
country seats and villages embosomed in wood; and the horizon melts
into an undulating line of remote hills.</p>

<h4>ANCIENT ECCLESIASTICAL ARCHITECTURE&#8212;CHURCHES OF ST. PAUL
AND ST. GERVAIS&#8212;HOSPITAL OF ST. JULIEN&#8212;CHURCHES OF
LERY, PAVILLY, AND YAINVILLE.</h4>
<p class="r">(<i>Rouen, June</i>, 1818.)</p>
<p>We, <i>East Angles</i>, are accustomed to admire the remains of
Norman architecture, which, in our counties, are perhaps more
numerous and singular than in any other tract in England. The noble
castle of Blanchefleur still honors our provincial metropolis, and
although devouring eld hath impaired her charms and converted her
into a very dusky beauty, the fretted walls still possess an air of
antique magnificence which we seek in vain when we contemplate the
towers of Julius or the frowning dungeons of Gundulph. Our
cathedral retains the pristine character which was given to the
edifice, when the Norman prelate abandoned the seat of the Saxon
bishop, and commanded the Saxon clerks to migrate into the city
protected or inclosed by the garrison of his cognate conquerors.
Even our villages abound with these monuments. The humbler, though
not less sacred structures in which the voice of prayer and praise
has been heard during so many generations, equally bear witness to
Norman art, and, I may say, to Norman piety; and when we enter the
sheltered porch, we behold the fantastic sculpture and varied
foliage, encircling the arch which arose when our land was ruled by
the Norman dynasty.</p>
<p>Comparatively speaking, Rouen is barren indeed of such relics.
Its military antiquities are swept away; and <a name="Page_123" id=
"Page_123"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;123]</span></a>the only
specimens of early ecclesiastical architecture are found in the
churches of St. Paul and St. Gervais, both of them, in themselves,
unimportant buildings, and both so disfigured by subsequent
alterations, that they might easily escape the notice of any but an
experienced eye. Of these, the first is situated by the side of the
road to Paris, under Mont Ste. Catherine, yet, still upon an
eminence, beneath which are some mineral springs, that were long
famous for their medicinal qualities, but have of late years been
abandoned, and the spa-drinkers now resort to others in the quarter
of the town called <i>de la Mar&#233;querie</i>. Both the one and
the other are highly ferruginous, but the latter most strongly
impregnated with iron.</p>
<p>The chancel is the only ancient part of the present church of
St. Paul's, and even this must be comparatively modern, if any
confidence may be placed in the current tradition, that the
building, in its original state, was a temple of Adonis or of
Venus, to both which divinities the early inhabitants of Rouen are
reported to have paid peculiar homage. They were worshipped in vice
and impurity<a name="FNanchor63" id="FNanchor63"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a>; nor were the votaries deterred
by the evil spirits who haunted the immediate vicinity of the
temple, and who gave rise to so fetid and infectious a vapor, that
it often proved fatal! This very remark seems to indicate the scite
of the church of St. Paul, with its neighboring sulphureous waters.
St. Romain demolished the temple, and dispersed the sinners. Farin,
in his <i>History of Rouen</i><a name="FNanchor64" id=
"FNanchor64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>, says,
that the church was repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt by the Norman
Dukes, to some of whom, the chancel, which is now standing,
probably owes its<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;124]</span></a> existence. The nave is
evidently of much more modern construction: it is thrice the width
of the other part, from which it is separated by a circular arch.
The eastern extremity differs from that of any other church I ever
saw in Normandy or in England: it ends in three circular
compartments, the central considerably the largest and most
prominent, and divided from the others, which serve as aisles, by
double arches, a larger and smaller being united together. This
triple circular ending is, however, only observable without; for,
in the interior, the southern part has been separated and used as a
sacristy; the northern is a lumber-room. In the latter division, M.
le Prevost desired us to notice a piece of sculpture, so covered
with dirt and dust that it could scarcely be seen, but evidently of
Roman workmanship, and, probably, of the fourth century, if we may
judge from its resemblance to some ornaments<a name="FNanchor65"
id="FNanchor65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> upon
the pedestal of the obelisk raised by Theodosius, in the Hippodrome
of Constantinople. Our friend's conjecture is, that it had
originally served for an altar: perhaps it might, with equal
probability, be supposed to have been a tomb.&#8212;The corbels on
the exterior of this building are strange and fanciful.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_11" id="plate_11"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_11.png" height="405" width="600" alt=
"Sculpture, supposed Roman, in the Church of St. Paul, at Rouen" /></p>
<p>St. Gervais also stands without the walls of Rouen; but at the
opposite end of the town, upon a hill adjoining the Roman road to
Lillebonne, and near the Mont aux Malades, a place so called, as
having been selected in the eleventh century, on account of the
salubrity of its air, for the situation of a monastery, destined
for the reception of lepers. Upon this eminence, the Norman Dukes
had likewise originally a palace; and, it was to <a name="Page_125"
id="Page_125"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;125]</span></a>this,
that William the Conqueror caused himself to be conveyed, when
attacked with his mortal illness, after having wantonly reduced the
town of Mantes to ashes. Here, too, this mighty monarch breathed
his last, and left a sad warning to future conquerors, deserted by
his friends and physicians the moment he was no more; while his
menials plundered his property, and his body lay naked and
neglected in the hall<a name="FNanchor66" id=
"FNanchor66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The ducal palace, and the monastic buildings of the priory, once
connected with it, are now completely destroyed. Fortunately,
however, the church still remains, though parochial and in poverty.
It preserves some portions of the original structure, more
interesting from their features than their extent. The exterior of
the apsis is very curious: it is obtusely angular, and faced at the
corners with large rude columns, of whose capitals some are Doric
or Corinthian, others as wild as the fancies of the Norman lords of
the country. None reach so high as the cornice of the roof, it
having been the intention of the original architect, that a portion
of work should intervene between the summit of the capitals and
this member. A capital to the north is remarkable for the eagles
carved upon it, as if with some allusion to Roman power. But the
most singular part of this church is the crypt under the apsis, a
room about thirty feet long by fourteen wide, and sixteen high, of
extreme simplicity, and remote antiquity. Round it runs a plain
stone bench; and it is divided into two unequal parts by a circular
arch, devoid of columns or of any ornament whatever, but
disclosing, in the composition of its piers, Roman bricks and other
<i>d&#233;bris</i>, some of them rudely sculptured. Here, according
to Ordericus <a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;126]</span></a>Vitalis<a name="FNanchor67" id=
"FNanchor67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a>, was
interred the body of St. Mellonus, the first Archbishop of Rouen,
and one of the apostles of Neustria; and here, his tomb, and that
of his successor, Avitien, are shewn to this day, in plain niches,
on opposite sides of the wall. St. Mello's remains however, were
not suffered to rest in peace; for, about five hundred and seventy
years after his death, which happened in the year 314, they were
removed to the castle of Pontoise, lest the canonized corpse should
be violated by the heathen Normans. In the diocese of Rouen St.
Mello is honored with particular veneration; and the history of the
prelates of the see contains many curious, and not unedifying
stories of the miracles he performed. His feast, together with that
of St. Nicasius, his companion, is celebrated on the second of
October; and their labors are commemorated with a hymn appointed
for their festival:&#8212;</p>

<p>Heretics as we are, we ought not to refrain from respecting the
zeal even of a saint of the Catholic calendar, when thus exerted.
Besides which, he has another claim <a name="Page_127" id=
"Page_127"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;127]</span></a>upon our
attention: our own island gave him birth, and he appeared at Rome
as the bearer of the annual tribute of the Britons, at the very
time when he was converted to Christianity, whose light he had
afterwards the glory of diffusing over Neustria. The existence of
these tombs and the antiquity of the crypt, recorded as it is by
history and confirmed by the style of its architecture, have given
currency to the tradition, which points it out as the only temple
where the primitive Christians of Neustria dared to assemble for
the performance of divine service. Many stone coffins have also
been discovered in the vicinity of the church. These sarcophagi
seem to confirm the general tradition: they are of the simplest
form, and apparently as ancient as the crypt; and they were so
placed in the ground that the heads of the corpses were turned to
the east, a position denoting that the dead received Christian
burial.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_12" id="plate_12"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_12.png" height="512" width="394" alt=
"Circular Tower, attached to the Church of St. Ouen, at Rouen" /></p>
<p>Another opportunity will be afforded me of speaking of the
church of St. Ouen; but, as a singular relic of Norman
architecture, I must here notice the round tower on the south side
of the choir, probably part of the original edifice, finished by
the Abbot, William Balot, and dedicated by the Archbishop
G&#233;offroi, in 1126. It consists of two stories, divided by a
billetted moulding. Respecting its use it would not now be easy to
offer a probable conjecture: the history of the abbey, indeed,
mentions it under the title of <i>la Chambre des Clercs</i>, and
supposes that it was formerly a chapel<a name="FNanchor68" id=
"FNanchor68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a>; but
its shape and size do not seem to confirm that opinion.</p>
<p>The chapel of the suppressed lazar-house of St. Julien, situated
about three miles from Rouen, on the opposite <a name="Page_128"
id="Page_128"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;128]</span></a>side
of the Seine, is more perfect than either St. Paul or St. Gervais,
and, consequently, more valuable to the architect. This building,
without spire or tower, and divided into three parts of unequal
length and height, the nave, the choir, and the circular apsis,
externally resembles one of the meanest of our parish-churches,
such as a stranger, judging only from the exterior, would be almost
equally likely to consider as a place of worship, or as a barn. It
is, however, if I am not mistaken, one of the purest and most
perfect specimens of the Norman &#230;ra. I know of no building in
England, which resembles it so nearly as the chancel of Hales
Church, in Norfolk; but the latter has been exposed to material
alterations, while the chapel of which I am speaking is externally
quite regular in its design, being divided throughout its whole
length into small compartments, by a row of shallow buttresses
rising from the ground to the eaves of the roof, without any
partition into splays. Those on the south side are still in their
prim&#230;val state; but a buttress of a subsequent, though not
recent, date, has been built up against almost every one of the
original buttresses on the north side, by way of support to the
edifice. Each division contains a single narrow circular-headed
window: beneath these is a plain moulding, continued
uninterruptedly over the buttresses as well as the wall, thus
proving both to be coeval; another plain moulding runs nearly on a
level with the tops of the windows, and takes the same circular
form; but it is confined to the spaces between the buttresses.
There are no others. The entrance was by circular-headed doors at
the west end and south side, both <a name="Page_129" id=
"Page_129"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;129]</span></a>of them
very plain; but particularly the latter. The few ornaments of the
western are as perfect and as sharp as if the whole were the work
of yesterday. This part of the church has, however, been exposed to
considerable injury, owing to its having joined the conventual
buildings, which were destroyed at the revolution. The inside is,
like the exterior, almost perfect, but it is very much more rich,
uniting to the common ornaments of Norman architecture, capitals,
in some instances, of classical beauty. The ceiling is covered with
paintings of scriptural subjects, which still remain,
notwithstanding that the building is now desecrated, and used as a
woodhouse by the neighboring farmer.</p>
<p>The date of the erection of the chapel is well
ascertained<a name="FNanchor69" id="FNanchor69"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a>. The hospital was founded in
1183, by Henry Plantagenet, as a priory for the reception of
unmarried ladies of noble blood, who were destined for a religious
life, and had the misfortune to be afflicted with leprosy. One of
their appellations was <i>filles meselles</i>, in which latter
word, you will immediately recognize the origin of our term for the
disease still prevalent among us, the <i>measles</i>. Johnson
strangely derives this word from <i>morbilli</i>; but the true
northern roots have been given by Mr. Todd, in his most valuable
republication of our national dictionary; a work which now deserves
to be named after the editor, rather than the original compiler. It
may also be added, that the word was in common use in the old
Norman French, and was plainly intended to designate a slight
degree of scurvy.</p>
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;130]</span></a>
<p>To pursue this subject a few steps farther, Jamieson, who is as
excellent in points of etymology as Johnson is deficient, quotes,
in his Scottish Dictionary, an instance where the identical
expression, <i>meselle-houses</i>, is used in old English;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"...to <i>meselle-houses</i> of that same rond,</p>
<p>Thre thousand mark unto ther spense he fond."</p>
<p class="i5">R. BRUNNE, p. 136.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Norfolk farmers and dairy-maids tell us to this day of
<i>measly pork</i>: in Scotch, a leper is called a <i>mesel</i>;
and, among the Swedes, the word for measles is one nearly similar
in sound, <i>m&#228;ss-ling</i>. The French academy, however, have
refused to admit <i>meselle</i> to the honor of a place in their
language, because it was obsolete or vulgar in the time of Louis
XIIIth. The word is expressive, and no better one has supplied its
place; and we may suppose that it was introduced by the Norman
conquerors, and that it properly belongs to the Gothic tongues, in
the whole of which the root is to be found more or less modified.
Instances of this kind, and they are many, serve as additional
proofs, if proofs indeed were needed, of the common origin of the
Neustrian Normans, of the Lowland Scots, and of the Saxon and
Belgian tribes, who peopled our eastern shores of England.</p>
<p>The priory continued to be appropriated to its original purpose
till 1366, when Charles Vth united it to the hospital, called the
Magdalen, at Rouen, upon condition that a mass should be celebrated
there daily for the repose of his soul. In the year 1600, on the
destruction of the abbey upon Mont Ste. Catherine, the monks of
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;131]</span></a>that establishment were allowed
to fix themselves at St. Julien; but they resigned it, after a
period of sixty-seven years, to the Carthusians of Gaillon, who,
incorporating themselves with their brethren of the same order at
Rouen, formed a very opulent community. The monastery, previously
occupied by the latter, was known by the poetical appellation of
<i>la Rose de Notre Dame</i>: indeed, it is thus termed in the
charter of its foundation, dated 1384. But the situation was
unhealthy, and the new comers had therefore little difficulty in
persuading its occupants to remove to the convent of St. Julien,
which they inhabited conjointly till the revolution. At a very
short period before that event, they had rebuilt the whole of the
priory with such splendor, that it was one of the most magnificent
in the neighborhood. But the edifice, which had then been scarcely
raised, was soon afterwards levelled with the ground. The
foundations alone attest the former extent of the buildings; and
the park, now in a state of utter neglect, their original
importance.</p>
<p>Rouen, as I have observed, is scantily ornamented with remains
of <i>real</i> Norman architecture; for, even at the risk of a
bull, we must deny that title to the Norman edifices of the pointed
style. Its vicinity, however, furnishes a greater number of
specimens, among which the churched of <i>L&#233;ry</i>, of
<i>Pavilly</i>, and of <i>Yainville</i>, are all of them deserving
of a visit from the diligent antiquary.</p>
<p>L&#233;ry is a village adjoining Pont-de-l'Arche: its church is
cruciform, having in the centre a low, massy, square tower,
surmounted by a modern spire. A row of plain Norman arches,
intended only for ornament, runs <a name="Page_132" id=
"Page_132"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;132]</span></a>round
the tower near the base, and over them on each side is a single
round-headed window. All the other windows of the building are of
the same construction, and this renders it probable that the east
end, in which there is also one of these windows, is really coeval
with the rest of the church; though, contrary to the usual plan of
the Norman churches, it is terminated by a straight wall instead of
a semi-circular apsis. The west front contains a rich Norman
door-way, surmounted by three windows of the same style, adjoining
each other, with a triple row of the chevron-ornament above them.
The interior wears the appearance of remote antiquity: the arches
are without mouldings, the pillars without bases, and the capitals
are destitute of all ornamental sculpture. In fact, these portions
are nothing but rounded piers; and so obviously was mere solid
strength the aim of the architect, that their diameter is fully
equal to two-thirds of their height. A double row of pillars and
arches separates the nave into three parts, of unequal width; and
another arch of greater span, though equally plain, divides it from
the chancel. In St. Julien, we observe a most simple exterior,
accompanied by an interior of comparatively an ornamented style:
here the case is exactly the reverse; but in neither instance does
there appear any reason to doubt that the whole of the building is
coeval. We shall be driven, therefore, to admit, that any
inferences respecting the &#230;ra of architecture drawn merely
from the comparative richness of the style, must be considered of
little weight, and that, even in those days, a great deal depended
upon the fancy of the patron or architect. Of the real time of the
erection <a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;133]</span></a>of the church at L&#233;ry,
there is no certain knowledge. Topographers, however minute in
other matters, seem in general to have considered it beneath their
dignity to record the dates of parish-churches; though, as
connected with the history of the arts, such information is
exceedingly valuable. Lauglois, who has given a figure of the
western front of this at L&#233;ry, refers it without any
hesitation to the time of the Carlovingian dynasty. But this
opinion is merely grounded on the resemblance of some of its
capitals to those of the pillars in the crypt at St. Denis; the
best judges doubt whether there is a single architectural line in
that crypt, which can fairly be referred to the reign of
Charlemagne. Hence such a proof is entitled to little attention;
and On studying the style of the whole, and its conformity with the
more magnificent front of St. Georges de Bocherville, it would seem
most reasonable to regard them both as of nearly the same &#230;ra,
the time of the Norman Conquest. We may through them be enabled to
fix the date to a specimen of ancient architecture in our own
country, more splendid than these, the Church of Castle Rising,
whose west front is so much on the same plan, that it can scarcely
have been erected at a very different period.</p>
<p>Pavilly has considerably more to recommend it, as the "magni
nominis umbra" than either of the others; it having been the seat
of an abbey founded about the year 668, and named after Saint
Austreberte, who first presided over it. Here, too, we have the
advantage of being able to ascertain with greater precision the
date of the building, which, in the archives of the Chartreux at
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;134]</span></a>Rouen<a name="FNanchor70" id=
"FNanchor70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a>, is
stated to have been constructed about the conclusion of the
eleventh century. The remains of the monastery are not
considerable: they consist of little more than a ruined wall,
containing three circular arches, evidently very ancient from their
simplicity and the style of their masonry, and some pillars with
capitals differing in ornament from any others I recollect, but
imitations of the Grecian, or rather attempts to improve upon it.
The inside of the parish-church is more interesting than the ruins
of the abbey. It is characterised, as you will observe in the
annexed sketch, by massy square piers, to each side of which are
attached several small clustered columns, intended merely for
ornament. One of them is fluted, the work, probably, of some
subsequent time; and another, on the same pier, is truncated, to
afford a pedestal for the statue of a saint. The capitals are
without sculpture.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_13" id="plate_13"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_13.png" height="502" width="350" alt=
"Interior of the Church at Pavilly" /></p>
<p>The church at Yainville differs materially from either of the
others: its square low central tower is of far greater base than
that of L&#233;ry: the transept parts of the cross have been
demolished; and, beyond the tower, to the east, is only an addition
that looks more like an apsis than a choir, a small semi-circular
building with a roof of a peculiarly high pitch, like those of the
stone-roofed chapels in Ireland, which, I trust, I shall be able
hereafter to convince you were undoubtedly of Norman origin. But
the most curious feature in this building is, that one of the
buttresses is pierced with a narrow lancet window; a decisive
proof, that the Normans regarded their <a name="Page_135" id=
"Page_135"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;135]</span></a>buttresses as constituent parts
of the edifice at its original construction, and that they did not
add them at a subsequent time, or design them to afford support, in
the event of any unexpected failure of strength. Indeed, what are
usually called Norman buttresses, such as we find at Yainville, and
at the lazar-house at St. Julien, have so very small a projection,
that they seem much more designed to add ornament or variety than
for any useful purpose.&#8212;Yainville is a parish adjoining
Jumieges, and was formerly dependent upon the celebrated abbey
there, which will furnish ample materials for a future letter.</p>

with a kind of regular base and capital, and thick walls without
any very prominent buttresses",<a name="FNanchor71" id=

<p>The style which an ingenious author of our own country has
designated as <i>early English</i><a name="FNanchor72" id=
"FNanchor72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a>, is by
no means uncommon in Normandy. In both countries, the circular
style became modified into <i>Gothic</i>, by the same gradations;
though, in Normandy, each gradation took place at an earlier period
than amongst us. The style in question forms the connecting link
between edifices of the highest antiquity, and those of the richest
pointed architecture; combined in some instances principally with
the peculiarities of the former, in others with the character of
the latter: generally speaking, it assimilates itself to both. The
simplicity of the principal lines betray its analogy to its
predecessors; whilst the form of the arch equally displays the
approach of greater beauty and perfection.</p>
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;137]</span></a>
<p>Of this &#230;ra, the cathedral<a name="FNanchor73" id=
"FNanchor73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> of
Rouen is unquestionably the most interesting building; and it is so
spacious, so grand, so noble, so elegant, so rich, and so varied,
that, as the Italians say of Raphael, "ammirar non si pu&#242; che
non s'onori."&#8212;By an exordium like this, I am aware that an
expectation will be raised, which it will be difficult for the
powers of description to gratify; but I have still felt that it was
due to the edifice, to speak of it as I am sure it deserves, and
rather to subject myself to the charge of want of ability in
describing, than of want of feeling in the appreciation of
excellence.</p>
<p>The west front opens upon a spacious <i>parvis</i>, to which it
exposes a width of one hundred and seventy feet, consisting of a
centre, flanked by two towers of very dissimilar form and
architecture, though of nearly equal height. Between these is seen
the spire, which rises from the intersection of the cross, and
which, from this point of view, appears to pierce the clouds; and
these masses so combine themselves together, that the entire
edifice assumes a pyramidical outline. The French, who, without any
real affection for ancient architecture, are often extravagant in
their praises, regard this spire as a "chef d'&#339;uvre de
hardiesse, d'&#233;l&#233;gance, et de l&#233;g&#232;ret&#233;."
Bold and light it certainly is; but we must pause before we
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;138]</span></a>consider it as elegant: the
lower part is a combination of very clumsy Roman pediments and
columns; and, as it is constructed of wood, the material conveys an
idea of poverty and comparative meanness.&#8212;It is commonly said
in France, that the portal of Rheims, joined to the nave of Amiens,
the choir of Beauvais, and the tower of Chartres, would make a
perfect church; nor is it to be denied that each of these several
cathedrals surpasses Rouen in its peculiar excellence; but each is
also defective in other respects; so that Rouen, considered as a
whole, is perhaps equal, if not superior, to any. The front is
singularly impressive: it is characterised by airy magnificence.
Open screens of the most elegant tracery, and filled, like the
pannels to which they correspond, with imagery, range along the
summit. The blue sky shines through the stone filagree, which
appears to be interwoven like a slender web; but, when you ascend
the roof, you find that it is composed of massy limbs of stone, of
which the edge alone is seen by the observer below. This
<i>free</i> tracery is peculiar to the pointed architecture of the
continent; and I cannot recollect any English building which
possesses it. The basement story is occupied by three wide
door-ways, deep in retiring mouldings and pillars, and filled with
figures of saints and martyrs, "tier behind tier, in endless
perspective." The central portal, by far the largest, projects like
a porch beyond the others, and is surmounted by a gorgeous
pyramidal canopy of open stone-work, in whose centre is a great
dial, the top of which partly conceals the rose window behind. This
portal, together with the niches above on either side, <a name=
"Page_139" id="Page_139"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;139]</span></a>all equally crowded with
bishops, apostles, and saints, was erected at the expence of the
cardinal, Georges d'Amboise, by whom the first stone was laid, in
1509<a name="FNanchor74" id="FNanchor74"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The lateral door-ways are of a different style of architecture,
and, though obtusely pointed, are supposed to be of the eleventh
century: a plain and almost Roman circular arch surmounts the
southern one. Over each of the entrances is a curious bas-relief:
in the centre is displayed the genealogical tree of Christ; the
southern contains the Virgin Mary surrounded by a number of saints;
the northern one, the most remarkable<a name="FNanchor75" id=
"FNanchor75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> of all,
affords a representation of the feast given by Herod, which ended
in the martyrdom of the Baptist. Salom&#232;, daughter of Herodias,
plays, as she ought to do, the principal character. The group is of
good sculpture, and curiously illustrative of the costumes and
manners of the times. Salom&#232; is seen dancing in an attitude,
which perchance was often assumed by the <i>tombesteres</i> of the
elder day; and her position affords a graphical comment upon the
Anglo-Saxon version of the text, in which it is said that she
"<i>tumbled</i>", before King Herod. The bands or pilasters (if we
may so call them) which ornament the jambs of the door-ways, are
crowned with graceful foliage <a name="Page_140" id=
"Page_140"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;140]</span></a>in a
very pure style; and the pedestals of the lateral pillars are
boldly underworked.</p>
<p>On the northern side of the cathedral is situated the
cloister-court. Only a few arches of the cloister now remain; and
it appears, at least on the eastern side, to have consisted of a
double aisle. Here we view the most ancient portion of the tower of
Saint Romain.&#8212;There is a peculiarity in the position of the
towers of this cathedral, which I have not observed elsewhere. They
flank the body of the church, so as to leave three sides free; and
hence the spread taken by the front of the edifice, when the
breadth of the towers is added to the breadth of the nave and
aisles. The circular windows of the tower which look in the court,
are perhaps to be referred to the eleventh century; and a smaller
tower affixed against the south side, containing a stair-case and
covered by a lofty pyramidical stone roof, composed of flags cut in
the shape of shingles, may also be of the same &#230;ra. The
others, of the more ancient windows, are in the early pointed
style; and the portion from the gallery upwards is comparatively
modern; having been added in 1477. The roof, I suppose, is of the
sixteenth century.</p>
<p>The southern tower is a fine specimen of the pointed
architecture in its greatest state of luxuriant perfection,
enriched on every side with pinnacles and statues. It terminates in
a beautiful octagonal crown of open stone-work.&#8212;Legendary
tales are connected with both the towers: the oldest borrows its
name from St. Romain, by whom chroniclers tell us that it was
built; the other is called the <i>Tour de Beurre</i>, from a
tradition, that the chief part of the money required for its
erection was <a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;141]</span></a>derived from offerings given by
the pious or the dainty, as the purchase for an indulgence granted
by Pope Innocent VIIIth, who, for a reasonable consideration,
allowed the contributors to feed upon butter and milk during Lent,
instead of confining themselves, as before, to oil and
lard.&#8212;The archbishop, Georges d'Amboise, consecrated this
tower, of which the foundation was laid in 1485; and he had the
satisfaction of living to see it finished, in 1507, after
twenty-two years had been employed in the building.</p>
<p>The cardinal was so truly delighted by the beauty of the
structure, which had arisen under his auspices, that he determined
to grace it with the largest bell in France; and such was
afterwards cast at his expence.&#8212;Even Tom of Lincoln could
scarcely compete with Georges d'Amboise; for thus the bell was duly
christened. It weighed thirty-three thousand pounds; its diameter
at the base was thirty feet; its height was ten feet; and thirty
stout and sweating bell-ringers could hardly put it into
swing.&#8212;Such was the importance attached to the undertaking,
that it was thought worthy of a religious ceremony. At the
appointed hour for casting the bell, the clergy paraded in full
procession round the church, to implore the blessing of heaven upon
the work; and, when the signal was given that the glowing metal had
filled the enormous mould, <i>Te Deum</i> resounded as with one
voice; the organ pealed, the trombones and clarions sounded, and
all the other bells in the cathedral joined, as loudly and as
sweetly as they could, in announcing the birth of their prouder
brother.&#8212;The remainder of the story is of a different
complexion:&#8212;The founder, Jean le Machon, of Chartres,
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;142]</span></a>died from excess of joy, and
was buried in the nave of the cathedral, where Pommeraye<a name=
"FNanchor76" id="FNanchor76"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> tells us the tomb existed in his
time; with a bell engraved upon it, and the following
epitaph:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">"Cy-dessous gist Jean le Machon</p>
<p class="i1">De Chartres homme de fa&#231;on</p>

<p class="i1">Mil cinq cens un jour d'Aoust deuxi&#232;me</p>
<p class="i1">Puis mourut le vingt et uni&#232;me."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nor was this the only misfortune; for, after all, this great
bell proved, like a great book, a great nuisance: the sound it
uttered was scarcely audible; and, at last, in an attempt to render
it vocal, upon a visit paid by Louis XVIth to Rouen in 1786, it was
cracked<a name="FNanchor77" id="FNanchor77"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>. It continued, however, to hang,
a gaping-stock to children and strangers, till the revolution, in
1793, caused it to be returned to the furnace, whence it re-issued
in the shape of cannon and medals, the latter commemorating the
pristine state of the metal with the humiliating legend, "monument
de vanit&#233; d&#233;truit pour l'utilit&#233;<a name="FNanchor78"
id="FNanchor78"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a>."</p>
<p>Some of the clerestory windows on the northern side of the nave
are circular: the tracery which fills them, and the mouldings which
surround them, belong to the pointed style; the arches may
therefore have been the production of an earlier architect. The
windows of the nave are crowned by pediments, each terminating, not
with a pinnacle, but with a small statue. The pediments <a name=
"Page_143" id="Page_143"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;143]</span></a>over the windows of the choir
are larger and bolder, and perforated as they rise above the
parapet; the members of the mouldings are full, and produce a fine
effect.</p>
<p>The northern transept is approached through a gloomy court, once
occupied by the shops of the transcribers and caligraphists, the
<i>libraires</i> of ancient times, and from them it has derived its
name. The court is entered beneath a gate-way of beautiful and
singular architecture, composed of two lofty pointed arches of
equal height, crowned by a row of smaller arcades. On each side are
the walls of the archiepiscopal palace, dusky and shattered, and
desolate; and the vista terminates by the lofty <i>Portal of St.
Romain</i>; for it is thus the great portal of the transept is
denominated. The oaken valves are bound with ponderous hinges and
bars of wrought iron, of coeval workmanship. The bars are
ornamented with embossed heads, which have been hammered out of the
solid metal. The statues which stood on each side of the arch-way
have been demolished; but the pedestals remain. These, as well as
other parts of the portal, are covered with sculptured
compartments, or medallions, in high preservation, and of the most
singular character. They exhibit an endless variety of fanciful
monsters and animals, of every shape and form, mermaids, tritons,
harpies, woodmen, satyrs, and all the fabulous zoology of ancient
geography and romance; and each spandril of each quatrefoil
contains a lizard, a serpent, or some other worm or reptile. They
have all the oddity, all the whim, and all the horror of the pencil
of Breughel. Human groups and figures are interspersed, some
scriptural, historical, or legendary; others mystical and
allegorical. <a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;144]</span></a>Engravings from these
medallions would form a volume of uncommon interest. Two lofty
towers ornament the transept, such as are usually seen only at the
western front of a cathedral. The upper story of each is perforated
by a gigantic window, divided by a single mullion, or central
pillar, not exceeding one foot in circumference, and nearly sixty
feet in height. These windows are entirely open, and the architect
never intended that they should be glazed. An extraordinary play of
light and shade results from this construction. The rose window in
the centre of the transept is magnificent: from within, the painted
glass produces the effect of a kaleidoscope.&#8212;The pediment or
gable of this transept was materially injured by a storm, in 1638,
one hundred and thirty years after it was completed; and the damage
was never restored.</p>
<p>The southern transept bears a near resemblance to that which I
have already described; but it was originally richer in its
ornaments, and it still preserves some of its statues. Here the
medallions relate chiefly to scripture-history; but the sculpture
is greatly corroded by the weather, and the more delicate parts are
nearly obliterated; besides which, as well here, as at the other
entrances, the Calvinists, in 1562, and, more recently, the
Revolutionists, have been most mischievously destructive,
mutilating and decapitating without mercy. The spirit, indeed, of
the French reformers, bore a near resemblance to the proceedings of
John Knox and his brethren: the people embraced the new doctrine
with turbulent violence. There was in it nothing moderate, nothing
gradual: it was not the regular flow of public <a name="Page_145"
id="Page_145"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;145]</span></a>opinion, undermining abuses,
and bringing them slowly to their fall; but it was the thunderbolt,
which&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"In sua templa furit, null&#226;que exire vetante</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Materi&#226;, magnamque cadens magnamque
revertens</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Dat stragem lat&#232; sparsosque recolligit
ignes."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Among the legends recorded on the southern portal, or the
<i>Portail de la Calende</i>, is that of the corn-merchant; the
confiscation of whose property paid, as the chronicles tell us, for
the erection of this beautiful entrance. He himself, if we may
believe the same authority, was hanged in the street opposite to
it, in consequence of having been detected in the use of false
measures.</p>
<p>The original Lady-Chapel, at the east end of the cathedral, was
taken down in 1302. The present, which is considerably more
spacious, is chiefly of a date immediately subsequent. Part,
however, was built in 1430, when new and larger windows were
inserted throughout the church; whilst other parts were not
finished till 1538, at which time the Cardinal Georges d'Amboise
restored the roof of the choir, which had been injured in 1514, by
the destruction of the spire.</p>
<p>The square central tower, which is low and comparatively plain,
is the work of the year 1200. It is itself more ancient than would
be supposed from the character of its architecture; but it occupies
the place of one of still greater antiquity, which was materially
damaged in 1117, when the original spire of the church was struck
by lightning. This first spire was of stone, but was <a name=
"Page_146" id="Page_146"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;146]</span></a>replaced by another of wood,
which, as I have just mentioned, was also destroyed at the
beginning of the sixteenth century. A fire, arising from the
negligence of plumbers employed to repair the lead-work, was the
cause of its ruin.&#8212;To remedy the misfortune, recourse was had
to extraordinary efforts: the King contributed twelve thousand
francs; the chapter a portion of their revenue and their plate;
collections were made throughout the kingdom; and Leo Xth
authorised the sale of indulgences, a measure, which, at nearly the
same period, in its more extensive adoption for the building of St.
Peter's at Rome, shook the Papacy to its foundation. The spire thus
raised, the second of wood, but the third in chronological order,
is the one which is now in existence. It was, like its predecessor,
endangered by the carelessness of the plumbers, in 1713; but it
does not appear to have required any material reparations till ten
years ago, when a sum of thirty thousand francs was expended upon
it.</p>
<p>From what has already been said, you will not have failed to
observe that this cathedral is the work of so many different
periods, that it almost contains within itself a history of pointed
architecture. To attempt a labored description of it were idle:
minute details of any one of the portals would fill a moderate
volume; and a quarto of seven hundred pages, from which I have
borrowed most of my dates, has already been written upon the
subject by a Benedictine Monk of the name of Pommeraye, who also
published the history of the Archbishops of the See<a name=
"FNanchor79" id="FNanchor79"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a>.</p>
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;147]</span></a>
<p>The first church at Rouen was built about the year 270: three
hundred and thirty years subsequently, this edifice was succeeded
by another, the joint work of St. Romain and St. Ouen, which was
burned in the incursions of the Normans, about the year 842. Fifty
years of Paganism succeeded; at the expiration of which period,
Rollo embraced the faith of Christ, and Rouen saw once more within
its walls, by the munificence and piety of the conqueror, a place
of Christian worship. Richard Ist, grandson of this duke, and his
son Robert, the archbishop, enlarged the edifice in the middle of
the tenth century; but it was still not completed till 1063, when,
according to Ordericus Vitalis, it was dedicated by the Archbishop
Maurilius with great pomp, in the presence of William, Duke of
Normandy, and the bishops of the province. Of this building,
however, notwithstanding what is said by Ducarel<a name=
"FNanchor80" id="FNanchor80"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> and other authors, it is certain
that nothing more remains than the part of St. Romain's tower, just
noticed, and possibly two of the western entrances; though the
present structure is believed to occupy the same spot.</p>
<p>To the honor of the spirit and good feeling of the inhabitants
of Rouen, this church is one of those that suffered least in the
outrages of the year 1793. Its dimensions, in French feet, are as
follows:&#8212;</p>

<p>Four clustered pillars support the central tower, each of which
is thirty-eight feet in circumference; the rest, of which there are
forty-four in the nave and choir, those in the former clustered,
the others circular, are less by one-third. The windows amount in
number to one hundred and thirty-three; the chapels to twenty-five.
Most of the latter were fitted up during the minority of Louis
XIVth, with wreathed columns, entwined with foliage, the style in
vogue in the seventeenth century. In the farthest of these chapels,
upon the south side, is the tomb of Rollo, first Duke of Normandy;
in the opposite chapel, that of his son and successor, William
Longue-Epe&#233;, who was treacherously murdered at Pecquigny, in
944, during a conference with Arnoul, Count of Flanders.</p>

<p>The effigies of both these princes still remain placed upon

the persons which they represent, but are probably productions of

what are called the most ancient in the <i>Mus&#233;e des Monumens
Fran&#231;ais</i>. At the same time, they may possibly have been
copied from others of earlier date; and I therefore send you a
slight sketch of the figure of Rollo. Even imaginary portraits of
celebrated men are not without their value: we are interested by
seeing how they have been conceived by the artist.&#8212;Above the

<p>with an account of the removal of his bones, exactly similar to
the concluding part of his father's epitaph.</p>
<p>The perspective on first entering the church is very striking:
the eye ranges without interruption, through a vista of lofty
pillars and pointed arches, to the splendid altar in the
Lady-Chapel, which forms at once an admirable termination to the
building and the prospect. The high altar in the choir is plain and
insulated. No other praise can be given to the screen, except that
it does not interrupt the view; for surely it was the very
consummation of bad taste to place in such an edifice, a double row
of eight modern Ionic pillars, in white marble, with the figures of
Hope and Charity between them, surmounted by a crucifix, flanked on
either side with two Grecian vases.</p>
<p>The interior falls upon the eye with boldness and regularity,
pleasing from its proportions, and imposing from its magnitude. The
arches which spring from the pillars of the aisles, are surmounted
by a second row, occupying the space which is usually held by the
triforium: the vaulted roof of the aisles runs to the level of the
top of this upper tier. This arrangement, which is found in other
Norman churches, is almost peculiar to these; and in England it has
no parallel, except in the nave of Waltham Abbey. Within the aisle
you observe a singular combination of small pillars, attached to
the columns of the nave: they stand on a species of bracket, which
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;151]</span></a>is supported by the abacus of
the capital; and they spread along the spandrils of the arches on
either side. These pillars support a kind of entablature, which
takes a triangular plan. The whole bears a near resemblance to the
style of the Byzantine architecture. Above the second row of arches
are two rows of galleries. The story containing the clerestory
windows crowns the whole; so that there are five horizontal

<p>The tombs that were originally in the choir, commemorating
Charles Vth, of France; Richard C&#339;ur de Lion; his elder
brother, Henry; and William, son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, were all
removed in 1736, as interfering with the embellishments then in
contemplation. The first of them alone was preserved and
transferred to the Lady-Chapel, where it has subsequently fallen a
victim to the revolution. The others are wholly destroyed; nor
could Ducarel find even a fragment of the effigies that had been
upon them; but engravings of these had fortunately been preserved
by Montfaucon<a name="FNanchor81" id="FNanchor81"></a><a href=

The monument of the celebrated John of Lancaster, third son of our

previously annihilated by the Calvinists. Lozenge-shaped slabs of
white marble, charged with inscriptions, were inserted in the
pavement over the spots that contain the remains of the princes,
and they have been suffered to continue <a name="Page_152" id=

<p>Of Prince William nothing is said; it was found, upon opening
his place of sepulture, that he had not been interred
here.&#8212;Richard strangely received a triple funeral. In
obedience to his wishes, his heart was buried at Rouen, while his
body was carried to Fontevraud, and his entrails were deposited in
the church of Chaluz, where he was killed:&#8212;this division is
commemorated in the quaint, yet energetic lines, which are said to

<p>Richard neither withheld his gifts nor his protection from the
metropolitan church; and, after his death, the <a name="Page_154"
id="Page_154"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;154]</span></a>chapter inclosed the heart of
their benefactor in a shrine of silver. But a hundred and fifty
years subsequently, the shrine was despoiled, and the precious
metal was melted into ingots, forming a portion of the ransom which
redeemed St. Louis from the fetters of his Saracen conqueror.</p>
<p>Henry the younger, who was crowned King of England during the
life-time of his father, against whom he subsequently revolted,
also requested on his death-bed, that his body might be interred in
this church; and his directions were obeyed, though not without
much difficulty; for the chapter of the cathedral of Mans, where
his servants rested with the body <i>in transitu</i>, seized and
buried it there; nor did those of Rouen recover the corpse, without
application to the Pope and to the King his father.</p>

"Monumental Figure of an Archbishop, in Rouen Cathedral" /></p>
<p>In the northern aisle of the choir, there still exists a curious
monument, in an injured state indeed, but well deserving of
attention, from its antiquity. It has been referred by tradition to
Maurice, or William of Durefort, both of them archbishops of Rouen,
and buried in the cathedral, the former in 1237, the latter in
1331; but the recumbent figure upon it seems of a yet more distant
date. It differs in several respects from any that I have seen in
England<a name="FNanchor82" id="FNanchor82"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a>. The tomb is in the wall, behind
a range of pillars, which form a kind of open screen round the
apsis. Below the effigy, it is decorated with a row <a name=
"Page_156" id="Page_156"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;156]</span></a>of whole-length figures of
saints, much mutilated: the circular part above is lined with
angels, a couple of whom <a name="Page_157" id=

<p>The Lady-Chapel contains two monuments of great merit, and
which, considered as specimens of matured art, have now no rivals
in Normandy; for both owe their origin to a period of refinement
and splendor. The sepulchre raised over the bodies of the two
Cardinals of Amboise, successively Archbishops of Rouen, towers on
the southern side of the chapel. The statues of the cardinals are
of white marble. The prelates appear kneeling in prayer; and the
following inscription, engraved in a single line, and not divided
into verses, is placed beneath them:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p class="i3">AT VIRTUS MORTIS NESGIA MORTE VIRET.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Immediately behind the cardinals are figures of patron saints; a
centre tablet represents St. George and the Dragon; above are the
apostles; below, the seven cardinal virtues. The execution of these
is particularly admired, especially that of the figure of Prudence;
but a row of still smaller figures, in devotional attitudes, carved
upon <a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;158]</span></a>the pilasters between the
virtues, are in higher taste. Various arabesques in basso-relievo,
of great beauty, and completely in the style of the <i>Loggie</i>
of Raphael, adorn the other parts of this sumptuous tomb.&#8212;As
a whole it is unquestionably grand, and it is yet farther valuable
as an illustration of the gorgeous taste that prevailed at the end
of the fifteenth century; but the mixture of black and white marble
and gilding has by no means a good effect, and every part is
overloaded with ornaments<a name="FNanchor85" id=
"FNanchor85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a>. These,
however, are the faults of the times: its merits are its own.</p>
<p>On the north side of the chapel is entombed the Duke of
Brez&#233;, once Grand Seneschal of Normandy; his tomb is chaste
and simple, forming a pleasing contrast to the elaborate memorial
of the cardinals. The statue of the seneschal himself, represented
stretched as a corpse, upon a black marble sarcophagus, is
admirable for its execution. The rigid expression of death is
visible, not only in the countenance, but extends through every
limb. Diana of Poitiers, a beauty who enjoys more celebrity than
good fame, erected the monument; and she caused her statue to be
placed on the tomb, where she is seen kneeling and contemplating.
In the following inscription she promises to be as faithful and
united to him after his death as she was while they both lived: and
she truly kept her word; for, during his life-time, she was
grievously <a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;159]</span></a>suspected of infidelity<a name=
"FNanchor86" id="FNanchor86"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a>, and she subsequently lived in
an open state of concubinage with Henry IInd, and was at last
buried at her own celebrated residence at Anet, twenty leagues from
her husband.&#8212;</p>

<p>A second female figure on the tomb, with a child in her arms,
has been supposed intended to represent the nurse of the duke; as
if the design of the sculptor had been to read a lesson to
mortality, by exhibiting the warrior in the helplessness of
infancy, in the vigor of manhood, and as a breathless corpse. Some
persons, however, consider it as a personification of Charity;
others suppose that it represents the Virgin Mary. In the midst was
originally an erect statue of De Brez&#233;, decorated with the
various symbols of his dignities; but this sinned beyond the hope
of redemption against the doctrines of liberty and equality, and it
was accordingly removed at the time of the revolution, together
with two inscriptions. One of them, which detailed his honors, with
the addition that he died July twenty-third, 1531, has recently
been recovered by the care of M. Riaux, and is restored to its
place. The other inscription and the effigy, it is feared, are
irrevocably lost. An equestrian statue in the upper part of the
monument was suffered to remain, and, as a record of the <a name=
"Page_160" id="Page_160"><span class=

sixteenth century, I annex a sketch of it. The armorial hearings

surmounted a figure of Temperance; the bridle in whose mouth shews
how absurd is allegory, when "submitted to the faithful eye."</p>

<p>Lenoir, who, in his work on the <i>Mus&#233;e des Monumens
Fran&#231;ais</i>, has treated much at large of the history of
Diana of Poitiers, and has figured her own beautiful mausoleum,
which he had the merit of rescuing from destruction,
pronounces<a name="FNanchor87" id="FNanchor87"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> this monument to be from the
hand of Jean Cousin, one of the most able sculptors of the French
school.</p>
<p>Over the altar in the Lady-Chapel is the only good painting in
the cathedral, the <i>Adoration of the Shepherds</i>, by Philip de
Champagne, a solid, well-colored, and well-grouped picture. Two
cherubs in the air are excellently conceived and drawn: the whole
is lighted from the infant Christ in the cradle, a <i>concetto</i>,
which has been almost universally adopted, since the time when
Corregio painted his celebrated <i>Notte</i>, now at Dresden.</p>
<p>There is no great quantity of painted glass in the church, but
much of it is of good quality. The windows of the choir, on either
side of the Lady-Chapel, are as rich as a profusion of brilliant
colors can make them; but the figures are so small, and so crowded,
that the subjects cannot be traced. They are said to be the work of
the thirteenth century. The painted windows in St. Stephen's
chapel, of the sixteenth century, are generally considered the best
in the cathedral. I own, however, that I should <a name="Page_161"
id="Page_161"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;161]</span></a>give
the preference to those in the chapel of St. Romain, in the south
transept. One of them is filled with allegorical representations of
the virtues of the archbishop; another with his miracles: every
part is distinct and clear, and executed with great force and great
minuteness. The vestments of the saint have all the delicacy of
miniature-painting.</p>
<p>The library of the cathedral, formerly one of the richest in
France, disappeared during the revolution; but the noble room which
contained it, one hundred feet long, by twenty-five feet wide,
still remains uninjured; as does the door which led into it from
the northern transept, and which continues to this day to bear the
inscription, <i>Bibliotheca</i>. The staircase, communicating with
this door, is delicate and beautiful. The balustrades are of the
most elegant filagree; and it has all the boldness and lightness
which peculiarly characterise the French Gothic. Its date being
well ascertained, we may note it as an architectural standard. It
was erected by the archbishop, Cardinal d'Etouteville, about the
year 1460, thirty or forty years subsequently to the building of
the room.</p>
<p>Respecting the contents of the sacristy, I can say little from
my own knowledge; but I find by Pommeraye, that, before the
revolution, it boasted of a large silver image of the Virgin,
endued with peculiar sanctity, a few drops of her milk, and a
portion of her hair<a name="FNanchor88" id=
"FNanchor88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a>; a
splinter <a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;162]</span></a>of the true cross, set in gold,
studded with pearls, sapphires, and turquoises; and reliques of
saints without <a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;163]</span></a>number. Now, however, it
appears, that of all its treasures, it has preserved little else
except the shrine of St. Romain, and another known by the general
name of <i>Chasse des Saints</i>. The former is two feet six inches
long, and one foot nine inches high, and is of handsome
workmanship, with a variety of figures on the sides, and St. Romain
himself at the top. Formerly it was supposed to be made of gold;
now I was assured by one of the canons, that it is of silver gilt;
but Gilbert<a name="FNanchor89" id="FNanchor89"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a>, who is a plain layman,
maintains that it is only copper. Had it been otherwise, it would
have contributed to the ways and means of the unchristian republic;
but the democrats spared it, for they had well ascertained that the
metal was base, and that the jewels, which adorn it, are but
glass.&#8212;This is not the original shrine which held the
precious relics: the shrine in which they were deposited by the
archbishop, William Bonne Ame, when first brought to the cathedral,
in 1090, was sold during a famine, and its proceeds distributed to
the starving poor; after which, in 1179, Archbishop Rotrou caused
another still more costly to be made; but the latter was broken to
pieces by the Calvinists, in 1562, and the saint's body cast into
the fire<a name="FNanchor90" id="FNanchor90"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Thus, then, I have led you, as far as I am able; through the
cathedral, adjoining which, at the east end, stands the palace of
the archbishop, a large building, but neither <a name="Page_164"
id="Page_164"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;164]</span></a>handsome nor conspicuous,
principally the work of the Cardinal Georges d'Amboise, though
begun by the Cardinal d'Etouteville, in 1461. The rooms in it which
are shewn to strangers are the anti-chamber, commonly called <i>la
salle de la Croix</i>, the library, and the great gallery. This
last, which is one hundred and sixty feet long, is also known by
the name of <i>la salle des Etats</i>. In it are placed four very
large paintings by Robert, an eminent French artist of
comparatively modern date. They represent the city of Rouen, the
town of Dieppe, that of Havre de Grace, and the archiepiscopal
palace at Gaillon. The view <a name="Page_165" id=
"Page_165"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;165]</span></a>of Rouen
represents in the foreground the <i>petit Ch&#226;teau</i>, and is
on that account peculiarly interesting. All of them are fine
paintings, but much injured by the damp. In the anti-chamber are
portraits of seven prelates of the see, and among them those of the
Cardinal de la Rochefoucault, and M. de Tressan: our guide could
name no others.</p>
<p>The present archbishop is the Cardinal Cambac&#233;r&#233;s,
brother to the ex-consul of that name, a man of moral life and
regular in his religious duties. He was placed here by
Napol&#233;on, all of whose appointments of this nature, with one
or two exceptions, have been suffered to remain; but I need
scarcely add that, though the title of archbishop is left, and its
present possessor is decorated with the Roman purple, neither the
revenue, nor the dignity, nor the establishment, resemble those of
former times. The chapter, which, before the revolution, consisted
of an archbishop, a dean, fifty canons, and ten prebendaries,
besides numberless attendants, now consists but of his eminence,
with the dean, the treasurer, the archdeacon, and twelve canons.
The independent annual income of the church, previous to the
revolution, exceeded one hundred thousand pounds sterling; but now
its ministers are all salaried by government, whose stated
allowance, as I am credibly informed, is to every archbishop six
hundred and twenty-five pounds per annum; to every bishop four
hundred and sixteen pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence; and to
every canon forty-one pounds thirteen shillings and four-pence. But
each of these stipends is doubled by an allowance of the same
amount from the department; and care is taken to select men of
independent property for the highest dignities.&#8212;From the
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;166]</span></a>foregoing scale, you may judge
of the state of the religious establishment in France. It is,
indeed, unjustly and unreasonably depressed, and there is much room
for amendment; but we must still hope and trust that things will
not soon regain their former standard, though attempts are daily
making to identify the Catholic clergy with the present dynasty;
and the most lively expectations are entertained from the
well-known character of some of the royal family.</p>

Milner had lately the kindness to write me upon the subject.</p>

<div class="blkquot">
<p>"The sepulchral monument in the cathedral of Rouen represents a
prelate; that is to say, Bishop or Mitred Abbot, as appears by his
mitre, gloves, ring, and sandals. But, as he bears the
<i>Pallium</i>, (to be seen on his neck, just above his breast, and
hanging down before him, almost to his feet) it appears that he is
a <i>Metropolitan</i>, or Archbishop, as, indeed, each of the
bishops of Rouen was, from the time of St. Ouen and St. Romanus, in
the seventh century, if not from that of St. Nicasius, in the third
or fourth. The statue has been mutilated in the mitre, the face,
and the crosier; probably when the Huguenots were masters of the
city. The mitre is low, as they used to be from the tenth century,
when they began to rise at all in the Latin Church, down to the
fourteenth, since which they have grown to their present
disproportioned height. The arms are crossed, as in prayer; and the
left arm supported a crosier, the remnant of which is seen under
that arm. Both hands are wrapped up in ornamented gloves, which
were an essential part of the prelatic dress. The principal
vestment is the <i>Planeta, Casula,</i> or <i>Chausible</i>; as it
was shaped till within these three or four hundred years.
Underneath that, and behind the hanging <i>Pallium</i>, appears the
<i>Dalmatic</i>, edged with gold lace; and under that, extending
the whole breadth of the figure, and finishing with rich and deep
thread lace, is the <i>Alb</i>, made of fine linen. The
<i>Tunic</i> is quite hidden by the dalmatic. The <i>Sandals</i>
appear to be of gold tissue, and to rest on a rich carpet.</p>
<p>"I ought to have mentioned, that the mitre appears, by the
jewels with which it is ornamented, to represent that which is
called <i>Mitra pretiosa</i>, from this circumstance. An inferior
kind of mitre, worn on less solemn occasions, was termed <i>Mitra
Aurifrygiata</i>; and a common one, made of plain linen or silk,
was termed <i>Simplex Mitra</i>. The only part of the dress which
puzzles me, is the great ornament on the neck and shoulders. The
question is, (which those can best determine who have seen the
original statue,) whether it adheres to the <i>Pallium</i>, or to
the <i>Casula</i>. In either case, it must be considered as part of
the vestment to which it adheres.</p>
<p>"It is quite out of my power to determine, or even to conjecture
on any rational grounds, which, of a certain three-score of
archbishops of Rouen, the figure represents; but, if I were to
choose between Maurice, the fifty-fourth archbishop, who died in
1235, and William, of Durefort, the sixty-first, who died in 1330,
from the comparative lowness of the mitre, and some other
circumstances of the dress, I should determine in favor of the
former. Perhaps it may represent our Walter, who was first Bishop
of Lincoln, and then transferred to Rouen, by Pope Lucius IIIrd. He
died in 1208, after having signalized himself as much as any of his
predecessors or successors have done.</p>
<p>"P.S. On consulting with an intelligent ecclesiastic of Rouen, I
am inclined to think that the above-mentioned ornament upon the
shoulders, is the <i>Mozetta</i>, being a short round cloak, which
all bishops still wear, with the <i>Rochet, Pectoral Cross</i>, and
<i>Purple Cassock</i>, as their <i>ordinary dress</i>; but, in
modern times, the <i>Mozetta</i> is laid aside, when the prelate
puts on his officiating vestments; though he retains the cassock,
cross, and rochet, underneath them. My informant says, that this
mozett is common on the tombs of bishops who died in former
ages."</p>

<h2>LETTER XI.</h2>
<h4>POINTED ECCLESIASTICAL ARCHITECTURE&#8212;THE CHURCHES OF ST.
OUEN, ST. MACLOU, ST. PATRICE, AND ST. GODARD.</h4>
<p class="r">(<i>Rouen, June</i>, 1818.)</p>
<p>In the religious buildings, the subject of my preceding letters,
I have endeavored to point out to you the specimens which exist at
Rouen, of the two earliest styles of architecture. The churches
which I shall next notice belong to the third, or <i>decorated</i>
style, the &#230;ra of large windows with pointed arches divided by
mullions, with tracery in flowing lines and geometrical curves, and
with an abundance of rich and delicate carving.</p>
<p>This style was principally confined in England to a period of
about seventy years, during the reigns of the second and third
Edward. In France it appears to have prevailed much longer. It
probably began there full fifty years sooner than with us, and it
continued till it was superseded by the revival of Grecian or
Italian architecture. I speak of France in general, but I must
again repeat, that my observations are chiefly restricted to the
northern provinces, the little knowledge which I possess of the
rest being derived from engravings. No where, however, have I been
able to trace among our Gallic neighbors the existence of the
simple <i>perpendicular</i> style, which is the most frequent by
far in our own country, nor of that more gorgeous variety
denominated by our antiquaries after the family of Tudor.</p>
<p>So long as Normandy and England were ruled by the same
sovereign, the continual intercourse created by this <a name=
"Page_168" id="Page_168"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;168]</span></a>union caused a similarity in
their architecture, as in other arts and customs; and therefore the
two earliest styles of architecture run parallel in the two
countries, each furnishing the counterpart of the other. Whether or
not the <i>decorated</i> style was transmitted to England from the
continent, is a question which cannot be solved, until our
collections of continental architecture shall become more
extensive. After the reign of Henry VIth, our intercourse with
Normandy wholly ceased; and, left to ourselves, many innovations
were gradually introduced, which were not known to the French
architects, who, with nicer taste, adhered to the pure style which
we rejected. Hence arose the <i>perpendicular</i> style of pointed
architecture, a style sufficiently designated by its name, and
obviously distinguished from its predecessors, by having the
mullions of its windows, its ornamental pannelling, and other
architectural members and features, disposed in perpendicular
lines. Finally, however, both countries discarded the Gothic style,
though at different &#230;ras. The revival of the arts in Europe,
in consequence of the capture of Constantinople and of the greater
commercial intercourse between transalpine Europe and Italy,
gradually gave rise to an admiration of the antique: imitation
naturally succeeded admiration; and buildings formed upon the
classical model generally replaced the Gothic. Italian architects
found earlier patrons and earlier scholars, in France, than amongst
us, our intermediate style being chiefly distinguished by its
clumsiness.</p>
<p>I will not detain you by any attempt at a comparison between the
relative beauties of the Gothic and Grecian architecture, or their
respective fitness for ecclesiastical <a name="Page_169" id=
"Page_169"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;169]</span></a>buildings. The very name of the
former seems sufficient to stamp its inferiority; and perhaps you
will blame the employment of a term which was obviously intended at
the outset as an expression of contempt; but I still retain the
epithet, as one generally received, and therefore, commonly
understood. It may be added, that the modern French seem to be the
only <i>Goths</i>, in the real and true acceptation of the word.
They, to the present day, build Gothic churches; but, instead of
confining themselves to the prototypes left them, they are
eternally aiming at alterations, under the specious name of
improvements. Horace was indignant that, in the Augustan age, the
meed of praise was bestowed only upon what was ancient: the
architects of this nation of recent date seem under the influence
of an opposite apprehension. They build upon their favorite
poet:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Loin d'ici ce discours vulgaire</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Que l'art pour jamais
d&#233;g&#233;n&#232;re,</p>
<p class="i5">&#160;Que tout s'&#233;clipse, tout finit;</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;La nature est in&#233;puisable,</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Et le g&#233;nie infatigable</p>
<p class="i5">&#160;Est le Dieu qui la rajeunit."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But they overlook, what Voltaire makes an indispensable
requisite, that art must be under the guidance of genius: when it
is not so, and caprice holds the reins, the result cannot fail to
be that medley of Grecian, Norman, Gothic, and Gallic, of which
this country furnishes too many examples.</p>
<p>The church of St. Ouen is unquestionably the noblest edifice in
the pointed style in this city, or perhaps in France; the French,
blind as they usually are to the <a name="Page_170" id=
"Page_170"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;170]</span></a>beauties
of Gothic architecture, have always acknowledged its merits. Hence
it escaped the general destruction which fell upon the conventual
churches of Rouen, at the time of the revolution; though, during
the violence of the storm, it was despoiled and desecrated. At one
period, it was employed as a manufactory, in which forges were
placed for making arms; at another, as a magazine for forage.</p>
<p>Nor was this the first instance of its being violated; for, like
most of the religious buildings at Rouen, it was visited in the
sixteenth century with the fury of the Calvinists<a name=
"FNanchor91" id="FNanchor91"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a>, who burned the bodies of St.
Ouen, St. Nicaise, and St. Remi, in the midst of the temple itself;
and cast their ashes to the winds of heaven. The <a name="Page_171"
id="Page_171"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;171]</span></a>other
relics treasured in the church experienced equal indignities. All
the shrines became the prey of the eager avarice of the Huguenots;
and the images of the saints and martyrs, torn from their
tabernacles, graced the gibbets which were erected to receive them
in various parts of Rouen.</p>
<p>Dom Pommeraye, in reciting these deplorable events, rises rather
above his usual pitch of passion: "O malheur!" he exclaims, "ces
corps sacr&#233;s, ces temples du Saint Esprit, qui avoient
autrefois donn&#233; de la terreur aux D&#233;mons, ne trouverent
ni crainte ni respect dans l'esprit de ces furieux, qui jetterent
au feu tout ce qui tomba entre leurs mains impies et
sacril&#232;ges!"&#8212;The mischief thus occasioned was infinitely
more to be lamented, he adds, than the burning of the church by the
Normans;&#8212;"stones and bricks, and gold and jewels, may be
replaced, but the loss of a relic is irreparable; and, moreover,
the abbey thus forfeits a portion of its protection in heaven; for
it is not to be doubted, but that the saints look down with eyes of
peculiar favor upon the spots that contain their mortal remains;
their glorified souls feeling a natural affection towards the
bodies to which they are hereafter to be united for ever," on that
day, when</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Ciascun ritrovera la trista tomba,</p>
<p class="i3">&#160;Ripigliera sua carne e sua figura,</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Udira ci&#242; che in eterno rimbomba."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The outrages were curiously illustrative of the spirit of the
times; the quantity of relics and ornaments equally characterise
the devotion of the votaries, and the reputed sanctity of the
place.</p>
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;172]</span></a>
<p>The royal abbey of St. Ouen had, indeed, enjoyed the veneration
of the faithful, during a lengthened series of generations.
Clothair is supposed to have been the founder of the monastery in
535; though other authorities claim for it a still higher degree of
antiquity by one hundred and thirty years. The church, whoever the
original founder may have been, was first dedicated to the twelve
apostles; but, in 689, the body of St. Ouen was deposited in the
edifice; miracles without number were performed at his tomb;
pilgrims flocked thither; his fame diffused itself wider and wider;
and at length, the allegiance of the abbey was tranferred to him
whose sanctity gave him the best claims to the advocation.</p>
<p>Changes of this nature, and arising from the same cause, were
frequent in those early ages: the abbey of St. Germain des
Pr&#233;s, at Paris, was originally dedicated to St. Vincent; that
of Ste. Genevieve to St. Peter; and many other churches also took
new patrons, as occasion required. According to one of the fathers
of the church, the tombs of the beatified became the fortifications
of the holy edifices: the saints were considered as proprietors of
the places in which their bodies were interred, and where power was
given them, to alter the established laws of nature, in favor of
those who there implored their aid. But the aid which they afforded
willingly to all their suitors, they could not bestow upon
themselves. And oft, when the sword of the heathen menaced the
land, the weary monks fled with the corpse of their patrons from
the stubborn enemy. Thus, St. Ouen himself, on the invasion of the
Normans, was transported to the priory of Gany, on the river Epte,
and thence to Cond&#233;; <a name="Page_173" id=
"Page_173"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;173]</span></a>but was
afterwards conveyed to Rouen, when Rollo embraced Christianity.
Other causes also contributed to the migration of these remains:
they were often summoned in order to dignify acts of peculiar
solemnity, or to be the witnesses to the oaths of princes, like the
Stygian marsh of old,</p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Dii cujus jurare timent et fallere
numen."</span>
<p>William the Conqueror, upon the dedication of the abbey of St.
Stephen, collected the bodies of all the saints in Normandy<a name=
"FNanchor92" id="FNanchor92"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Those who wish to be informed of the acts and deeds of St. Ouen,
may refer to Pommeraye's history of the convent, in which
thirty-seven folio pages are filled with his life and miracles; the
latter commencing while he was in long clothes. The monastery,
under his protection, continued to increase in reputation; and, in
the year 1042, the abbatial mitre devolved upon William, son of
Richard IInd, Duke of Normandy, who laid the foundation of a new
church, which, after about eighty years, was completed and
consecrated by William Balot, next but one to him in the
succession<a name="FNanchor93" id="FNanchor93"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>But this church did not exist long: ten years only had elapsed
when a fire reduced it, together with the whole abbey, to ashes. An
opportunity was thus afforded to the sovereign to shew his
munificence, and Richard C&#339;ur de Lion was not tardy in
availing himself of it; but a second fire in 1248 again dislodged
the monks; and they continued houseless, till the abbot, Jean
Rousel, <a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;174]</span></a>better known by the name of
<i>Mardargent</i>, laid the foundation in 1318, of the present
structure, an honor to himself, to the city, and to the nation. By
this prelate the building was perfected as far as the transept: the
rest was the work of subsequent periods, and was not completed till
the prelacy of Bohier, who died in the beginning of the sixteenth
century.</p>
<p>To speak more properly, I ought rather to say that it was not
till then brought to its present state; for it was never completed.
The western front is still imperfect. According to the original
design, it was to have been flanked by magnificent towers, ending
in a combination of open arches and tracery, corresponding with the
outline and fashion of the central tower. These towers, which are
now only raised to the height of about fifty feet, jut diagonally
from the angles of the facade; and it was intended that, in the
lower division, they should have been united by a porch of three
arches, somewhat resembling the west entrance of Peterborough; and
such as in this town is still seen, at St. Maclou, though on a much
larger scale. Pommeraye has given an engraving of this intended
front, taken from a drawing preserved in the archives of the abbey.
The engraving is miserably executed; but it enables us to
understand the lines of the projected building. Pommeraye has also
preserved details of other parts of the church, among them of the
beautiful rood-loft erected by the Cardinal d'Etouteville, and long
an object of general admiration. The bronze doors of this screen
were of a most singular and elegant pattern: Horace Walpole
imitated them in his bed-room, at Strawberry-Hill. The rood-loft,
which had been <a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;175]</span></a>maimed by the Huguenots, was
destroyed at the revolution; when the church was also deprived of
its celebrated clock, which told the days of the month, the
festivals, and the phases of the moon, and afforded other
astronomical information. Such gazers as heeded not these
mysteries, were amused by a little bronze statue of St. Michael,
who sallied forth at every hour, and announced the progress of
time, by the number of strokes which he inflicted on the Devil with
his lance.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_18" id="plate_18"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_18.png" height="454" width="274" alt=
"Tower of the Church of St. Ouen, at Rouen" /></p>
<p>It is impossible to convey by words an adequate idea of the
lightness, and purity, and boldness of St. Ouen. My imperfect
description will be assisted by the sketches which I inclose. Of
their merits I dare not speak; but I will warrant their fidelity;
The flying buttresses end in richly crocketed pinnacles, supported
by shafts of unusual height. The triple tiers of windows seem to
have absorbed the solid wall-work of the building. Balustrades of
varied quatrefoils run round the aisles and body; and the
centre-tower, which is wholly composed of open arches and tracery,
terminates, like the south-tower of the cathedral, with an
octangular crown of fleurs-de-lys. The armorial symbol of France,
which in itself is a form of great beauty, was often introduced by
the French architects of the middle ages, amongst the ornaments of
their edifices: it pleases the eye by its grace, and satisfies the
mind by its appropriate and natural locality.</p>
<p>The elegance of the south porch is unrivalled. This portion of
the church was always finished with care: it was the scene of many
religious ceremonies, particularly of espousals. Hence they gave it
a degree of magnitude which might appear disproportionate, did we
not recollect <a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;176]</span></a>that the arch was destined to
embower the bride and the bridal train. The bold and lofty entrance
of this porch is surrounded within by pendant trefoil arches,
springing from carved bosses, and forming an open festoon of
tracery. The vault within is ornamented with pendants, and the
portal which it shades is covered with a profusion of sculpture:
the death, entombment, and apotheosis of the Virgin, form the
subjects of the principal groups. The sculptures, both in design
and execution, far surpass any specimens of the corresponding
&#230;ra in England. But this porch is now neglected and filled
with lumber, and the open tracery is much injured. I hope, however,
it will receive due attention; as the church is at this time under
repair; and the restorations, as far as they go, have been executed
with fidelity and judgment.</p>

<p>The perspective of the interior<a name="FNanchor94" id=
"FNanchor94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> is
exceedingly impressive: the arches are of great height and fine
proportions. If I must discover a defect, I should say that the
lines appear to want substance; the mouldings of the <a name=
"Page_177" id="Page_177"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;177]</span></a>arches are shallow. The
building is all window. Were it made of cast iron, it could
scarcely look less solid. This effect is particularly increased by
the circumstance of the clerestory-gallery opening into the glazed
tracery of the windows behind, the lines of the one corresponding
with those of the other. To each of the clustered columns of the
nave is attached a tabernacle, consisting of a canopy and pedestal,
evidently intended originally to have received the image of a
saint. It does not appear to have been the design of the architect
that the pillars of the choir should have had similar ornaments;
but upon one of them, at about mid-height, serving as a corbel to a
truncated column, is a head of our Saviour, and, on the opposite
pillar, one of the Virgin: the former is of a remarkably fine
antique character. The capitals of the pillars in this part of the
church were all gilt, and the spandrils of the arches painted with
angels, now nearly effaced. The high altar is of grey marble,
relieved, by a scarlet curtain behind, the effect of which is
simple, singular, and good. Round the choir is a row of chapels,
which are wholly wanting to the nave. The walls of these chapels
have also been covered with fresco paintings; some with figures,
others with foliage. The chapels contain many grave-stones
displaying indented outlines of figures under canopies, and in
other respects ornamented; but neglected, and greatly obliterated,
and hastening fast to ruin. It is curious to see the heads and
hands, and, in one instance, the crosier of a prelate, inlaid with
white or grey marble; as if the parts of most importance were
purposely made of the most perishable <a name="Page_178" id=
"Page_178"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;178]</span></a>materials. I was much
interested by observing, that many of these memorials are almost
the exact counterparts of some of our richest English sepulchral
brasses, and particularly of the two which are perhaps unrivalled,
at Lynn<a name="FNanchor95" id="FNanchor95"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a>.&#8212;How I wished that you,
who so delight in these remains, and to whom we are indebted for
the elucidation of those of Norfolk, had been with me, while I was
trying to trace the resemblance; and particularly while I pored
over the stone in the chapel of Saint Agnes, that commemorates
Alexander Berneval, the master-mason of the building!</p>

<p>According to tradition, it was this same Alexander Berneval who
executed the beautiful circular window in the southern transept.
But being rivalled by his apprentice, who produced a more exquisite
specimen of masonry in the northern transept, he murdered his
luckless pupil. The crime he expiated with his own life; but the
monks of the abbey, grateful for his labors, requested that his
body might be entombed in their church; and on the stone that
covers his remains, they caused him to be represented at full
length, holding the window in his hand.</p>
<p>These large circular windows, sometimes known by the name of
rose windows, and sometimes of marigold windows, are a strong
characteristic feature of French ecclesiastical architecture. Few
among the cathedrals or the great conventual churches, in this
country, are without them. In our own they are seldom found: in no
one of our cathedrals, excepting Exeter only, are they in the
western front; and, though occasionally in <a name="Page_179" id=
"Page_179"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;179]</span></a>the
transepts, as at Canterbury, Chichester, Litchfield, Westminster,
Lincoln and York, they are comparatively of small size with little
variety of pattern. In St. Ouen, they are more than commonly
beautiful. The northern one, the cause of death to the poor
apprentice, exhibits in its centre the produced pentagon, or
combination of triangles sometimes called the pentalpha.&#8212;The
painted glass which fills the rose windows is gorgeous in its
coloring, and gives the most splendid effect. The church preserves
the whole of its original glazing. Each inter-mullion contains one
whole-length figure, standing upon a diapered ground, good in
design, though the artist seems to have avoided the employment of
brilliant hues. The sober light harmonizes with the grey unsullied
stone-work, and gives a most pleasing unity of tint to the receding
arches.</p>
<p>Among the pictures, the-best are, the <i>Cardinal of Bologna
opening the Holy Gate, instead of the Pope</i>, in the nave; and
<i>Saint Elizabeth stopping the Pestilence</i>, in the choir: two
others, in the Lady-Chapel, by an artist of Rouen, of the name of
Deshays, the <i>Miracle of the Loaves</i>, and the
<i>Visitation</i>, are also of considerable merit.&#8212;Deshays
was a young man of great promise; but the hopes which had been
entertained of him were disappointed by a premature death.</p>
<p>A church like this, so ancient, so renowned, and so holy, could
not fail to enjoy peculiar privileges. The abbot had complete
jurisdiction, as well temporal as spiritual, over the parish of St.
Ouen; in the Norman parliament he took precedence of all other
mitred abbots; <a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;180]</span></a>by a bull of Pope Alexander
IVth, he was allowed to wear the pontifical ornaments, mitre, ring,
gloves, tunic, dalmatic, and sandals; and, what sounds strange to
our Protestant ears, he had the right of preaching in public, and
of causing the conventual bells to be rung whenever he thought
proper. His monks headed the religious processions of the city; and
every new archbishop of the province was not only consecrated in
this church, but slept the evening prior to his installation at the
abbey; whence, on the following day, he was conducted in pomp to
the entrance of the cathedral, by the chapter of St. Ouen, headed
by their abbot, who delivered him to the canons, with the following
charge,&#8212;"Ego, Prior Sancti Audoeni, trado vobis Dominum
Archiepiscopum Rothomagensem vivum, quem reddetis nobis
mortuum."&#8212;The last sentence was also strictly fulfilled; the
dean and chapter being bound to take the bodies of the deceased
prelates to the church of St. Ouen, and restore them to the monks
with, "Vos tradidistis nobis Dominum Archiepiscopum vivum; nos
reddimus eum vobis mortuum, ita ut crastin&#226; die reddatis eum
nobis."&#8212;The corpse remained there four and twenty hours,
during which the monks performed the office of the dead with great
solemnity. The canons were then compelled to bear the dead
archbishop a second time from the abbey cross (now demolished) to
the abbey of St. Amand<a name="FNanchor96" id=
"FNanchor96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a>, where
the abbess took the pastoral <a name="Page_181" id=
"Page_181"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;181]</span></a>ring
from off his finger, replacing it by another of plain gold; and
thence the bearers proceeded to the cathedral. These duties could
not be very agreeable to portly, short-winded, well-fed
dignitaries; and consequently the worthy canons were often inclined
to shrink from the task. In the case of the funeral of Archbishop
d'Aubigny, in 1719, they contented themselves with carrying him at
once to his dormitory; but the prior and monks of St. Ouen
instantly sued them before the parliament, and this tribunal
decreed that the ancient service must be performed, and in default
of compliance, the whole of their temporalities were to be put
under sequestration: it is almost needless to add, that a sentence
of excommunication would scarcely have been so effectual in
enforcing the execution of the sentence.</p>
<p>The gardens formerly belonging to the abbey are at this time a
pleasant promenade to the inhabitants of the town: the remains of
the monastic buildings are converted into an <i>H&#244;tel de
Ville</i>, where also the library and the museum are kept, and the
academy hold their sittings. No remains, however, now exist of the
abbatial residence, which was built by Anthony Bohier, in the
beginning of the sixteenth century, and which, according to the
engraving given of it by Pommeraye, must have been a noble specimen
of domestic architecture. The sovereigns of France always took up
their abode in it, during their visits to Rouen.&#8212;The circular
tower called the <i>Tour des Clercs</i>, mentioned in a former
letter, is the only vestige of Norman times.&#8212;The cloister
corresponded with the architecture of the church: the south side of
the <a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;182]</span></a>quadrangle attached to the
northern aisle still exists, but blocked up and dilapidated, and
converted into a sort of cage for those who are guilty of
disturbances during the night.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_22" id="plate_22"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_22.png" height="450" width="267" alt=
"Stone Staircase in the Church of St. Maclou, at Rouen" /></p>
<p>The church of St. Maclou is unquestionably superior to every
other in the city, except the cathedral and St. Ouen. Its principal
ornament are its carved doors, produced during the reign of Henry
IIIrd, by Jean Goujon, a man so eminent as to have been termed the
Corregio of sculpture; but they have been materially injured by
repairs and alterations by unskilful hands. Within the church, near
the west entrance, is a singularly elegant stair-case, in filagree
stone-work, which formerly led to the organ.&#8212;This building
was erected in the year 1512, and chiefly by voluntary
contributions, if such can be called <i>voluntary</i> as were
purchased by promises from the archbishop, first of forty, and then
of one hundred, days' indulgences, to all who would contribute
towards the pious labor.&#8212;The central tower resembles that of
the cathedral, both in the interior and the exterior. It now
appears truncated; but it was originally surmounted by a spire,
which was of such beauty, that even Italian artists thought it
worthy to be engraved and held out as a model at Rome<a name=
"FNanchor97" id="FNanchor97"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a>. The spire, however, was greatly
injured by a hurricane, in 1705, and it was at last taken down
thirty years afterwards. To the triple porch, I have already
alluded, in describing the intended front of St. Ouen. The general
lines of the church, are such as in England would be referred to
the fourteenth century: on a closer examination, <a name="Page_183"
id="Page_183"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;183]</span></a>however, the curious eye will
discover the peculiar beauties of the French Gothic. Thus the
bosses of the groined roof are wrought and perforated into
filagree, the work extending over the intersections of the groins,
which are seen through its reticulations. Such bosses are only
found in the French churches of the sixteenth century. In other
parts, the interior closely resembles the style of the
cathedral<a name="FNanchor98" id="FNanchor98"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>St. Patrice is a building of the worst style of the commencement
of the sixteenth century: to use the quaint phraseology of Horace
Walpole, it exhibits "that <i>betweenity</i> which intervened when
Gothic declined and Palladian was creeping in." The paintings on
the walls of this church, and the stained glass in its windows, are
more deserving of notice than its architecture. The first are of
small size, and generally better than are seen in similar places.
One of them is after Bassan, an artist, whose works are not often
found in religious edifices in France. The painted windows of the
choir deserve unqualified commendation. They are said to have been
removed from St. Godard. Each is confined to a single subject;
among which, that of the <i>Annunciation</i> is esteemed the
best.</p>
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;184]</span></a>
<p>To this church was attached a confraternity<a name="FNanchor99"
id="FNanchor99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a>,
established in 1374, under the name of the <i>Guild of the
Passion</i>. Its annual procession, which continued till the time
of the revolution, took place on Holy-Thursday. It consisted of the
usual pageantry; a host of children, dressed like angels, increased
the train, which also included twelve poor men, whose feet the
masters of the brotherhood publicly washed after mass. Like some
other guilds, they were in possession of a pulpit or tribune,
called, in old French, a <i>Puy</i>, from which they issued a
general invitation to all poets, who were summoned to descant upon
the themes which were commemorated by their union. The rewards held
out to the successful candidates were, in the true monastic spirit
of the guild, a reed, a crown of thorns, a sponge, or some other
mystic or devotional emblem. Occasionally, too, they gave a scenic
representation of certain portions of religious history, according
to the practice of early times. The account of the <i>Mystery of
the Passion</i> having been acted in the burial-ground of the
church of St. Patrice, so recently as September, 1498, is preserved
by Taillepied<a name="FNanchor100" id="FNanchor100"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a>, who tells us, that it was
performed by "bons joueurs et braves personages." The masters of
this guild had the extraordinary privilege of being allowed to
charge the expence attendant on the processions and exhibitions,
upon any citizen they might think proper, whether a member or
otherwise.</p>
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;185]</span></a>
<p>The neighboring church of St. Godard possesses neither
architectural beauty, nor architectural antiquity; for, although it
occupies the scite of an edifice of remote date, yet the present
structure is coeval with St. Patrice. It has been supposed that
this church was the primitive cathedral of the city<a name=
"FNanchor101" id="FNanchor101"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a>. One of the proofs of this
assertion is found in a procession which, before the revolution,
was annually made hither by the chapter of the present cathedral,
with great ceremony, as if in recognition of its priority. The
church was originally dedicated to the Virgin; but it changed its
advocation in the year 525, when St. Godard, more properly called
St. Gildard, was buried here in a subterranean chapel; and, for the
reasons before noticed, the old tutelary patroness was compelled to
yield to the new visitor. In the succeeding century, St. Romain, a
saint of still greater fame, was also interred here; and, as I
collect from Pommeraye<a name="FNanchor102" id=
"FNanchor102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a>, in
the same crypt. This author strenuously denies the inferences which
have been drawn from the annual procession, which he maintains was
performed solely in praise and in honor of St. Romain; for the
chapter, after having paid their devotions to the Host, descended
into the chapel, to prostrate themselves before the sepulture of
the saint; on which subject, an antiquary<a name="FNanchor103" id=
"FNanchor103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> of
Rouen has preserved the following lines:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Ad regnum Domini dextr&#226; invitatus et ore,</p>
<p class="i3">&#160;Huic sacra Romanus credidit ossa loco;</p>
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;186]</span></a>
<p class="i1">Sontibus addixit qu&#230; c&#230;ca rebellio

<p class="i3">&#160;Nec tulit impietas majus in urbe scelus.</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Quid tanto vesana malo profecit Erynnis?</p>
<p class="i3">&#160;Ipsa sui testis pignoris extat humus.</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Crypta manet, memoresque trahit confessio

saxis,</p>
<p class="i3">&#160;Est aliquid soboli patris habere thorum."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The body of St. Godard was carried to Soissons; but the tomb,
which, has doubtfully been designated as appropriated either to him
or to St. Romain, was left to the church, and remained there at
least till the revolution. I have even been told that it is there
still; but I had no opportunity of going down into the chapel to
verify this point. It consisted, or rather consists, of a single
slab of jasper, seven and a half feet long, by two feet wide, and
two feet four inches thick. Upon it was this
inscription:&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Malades, voulez-vous soulager vos douleurs?</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Visitez ce tombeau, baignez-le de vos
pleurs;</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Rechauffez vos esprits d'une divine flame;</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Touchez-le settlement du doigt,</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Et vous y trouverez (si vous avez la foi)</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Et la sant&#233; du corps, et la sant&#233; de
l'ame."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The building retains, at this time, only two of its celebrated
painted windows; but they are fortunately the two which were always
considered the best. One of them represents the history of St.
Romain; the other, the genealogy of Jewish kings, from whom the
Holy Virgin descended. Rouen has, from a very early period, been
famous for its manufactories of painted glass. But the windows of
this church were still esteemed the <i>chef d'&#339;uvre</i> of its
artists; and these had so far passed into a <a name="Page_187" id=
"Page_187"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;187]</span></a>proverb,
that Farin<a name="FNanchor104" id="FNanchor104"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> tells us it was common
throughout France to say, in recommendation of choice wine, that
"it was as bright as the windows of St. Godard." The saying,
however, was by no means confined to Rouen, for it was also applied
to the windows of the Ste. Chapelle, at Dijon.</p>
<p>It was at St. Godard that the burst of the reformation was first
manifested. The Huguenots, taking courage from the secret increase
of their numbers, broke into the building, in 1540, demolished the
images, and sold the pix to a goldsmith. But the man suffered
severely for his purchase: he was shortly afterwards sentenced, by
a decree of the parliament, to be hanged in front of his shop; and
two of those concerned in the outrage also suffered capital
punishment. The spark thus lighted, afterwards increased into a
conflagration; and, to this hour, there is a larger body of
Protestants at Rouen, than in most French towns.</p>
<p>I do not expect that you will reproach me with the prolixity of
these details. The subject is attractive to me, and I feel that you
will accompany me with pleasure in my pilgrimage, from chapel to
shrine, dwelling with me in contemplation on the relics of ancient
skill and the memorials of the piety of the departed. Nor must it
be forgotten, that the hand of the spoliator is falling heavily on
all objects of antiquity. And the French seem to find a source of
perverse and malignant pleasure in destroying the temples where
their ancestors once worshipped: many are swept away; a greater
number continue <a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;188]</span></a>to exist in a desecrated state;
and time, which changes all things, is proceeding with hasty
strides to obliterate their character. The lofty steeple hides its
diminished head; the mullions and tracery disappear from the
pointed windows, from which the stained glass has long since
fallen; the arched entrance contracts into a modern door-way; the
smooth plain walls betray neither niches, nor pinnacles, nor fresco
paintings; and in the warehouse, or manufactory, or smithy, little
else remains than the extraordinary size, to point out the original
holy destination of the edifice.</p>

NORMANDY&#8212;GUILD OF THE CONARDS&#8212;JOAN OF

ROBEC&#8212;HOSPITALS&#8212;MINT.</h4>
<p class="r">(<i>Rouen, June</i>, 1818.)</p>
<p>Amongst the secular buildings of Rouen, the Palais de Justice
holds the chief place, whether we consider the magnificence of the
building, or the importance of the assemblies which once were
convened within its precinct.</p>
<p>The three estates of the Duchy of Normandy, the parliament,
composed of the deputies of the church, the nobility, and the good
towns, usually held their meetings in the Palace of Justice. Until
the liberties of France were wholly extirpated by Richelieu, this
body opposed a formidable resistance to the crown; and the
<i>Charte Normande</i> was considered as great a safeguard to the
liberties of the subject, as Magna Charta used to be on your side
of the channel. Here, also, the <i>Court of Exchequer</i> held its
session. According to a fond tradition, this, the supreme tribunal
of Normandy, was instituted by Rollo, the good Duke, whose very
name seemed to be considered as a charm averting violence and
outrage. This court, like our <i>Aula Regia</i>, long continued
ambulatory, and attendant upon the person of the sovereign; and its
sessions were held occasionally, and at his pleasure. The progress
of society, however, required that the supreme tribunal should
become stationary and <a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;190]</span></a>permanent, that the suitors
might know when and where they might prefer their claims. Philip
the Fair, therefore, about the year 1300, began by enacting that
the pleas should be held only at Rouen. Louis the XIIth remodelled
the court, and gave it permanence; yielding in these measures to
the prayer of the States of Normandy, and to the advice of his
minister, the Cardinal d'Amboise. It was then composed of four
presidents, and twenty-eight counsellors; thirteen being clerks;
and the remainder laymen. The name of exchequer was perhaps
unpleasing to the crown, as it reminded the Normans of the ancient
independence of their duchy; and, in 1515, Francis Ist ordered that
the court should thenceforward be known as the <i>Parliament of
Normandy</i>; thus assimilating it in its appellation to the other
supreme tribunals of the kingdom. There is an old poem extant,
written in very lawyer-like rhyme, which invests all the cardinal
virtues, and a great many supernumerary ones besides, with the
offices of this most honorable court, in which purity is the usher,
truth has a silk gown, and virginity enters the proceedings on the
record.</p>

<p>In the same style and strain is a ballad, which, thanks to the
care of De Bourgueville, the author of the <i>Antiquities of
Caen</i>, hath been preserved for the edification of posterity. It
enumerates all the members of the court <i>seriatim</i>, and
compares their lordships and worships, one after another, to the
heroes and demi-gods of ancient story.</p>
<p>The parliament in its turn has given way to the <i>Court of
Assizes</i>; and, where the states once deliberated, the electors
of the department now come together for the purpose of naming the
deputies who represent them in the great council of the
nation;&#8212;such are the vicissitudes of all human
institutions.</p>
<p>When the Jews were expelled from Normandy, in 1181, the
<i>Close</i>, or Jewry, in which they dwelled, escheated to the
king. The sons of Japhet spoiled the sons of Shem with pious
alacrity. The debtor burnt his bond; the bailie seized the store of
bezants; the synagogue was razed to the ground. In this
<i>Close</i> the palace was afterwards built. The wise custom of
Normandy was mooted on the spot where the law of Moses had once
been taught; and, by a strange, perhaps an ominous, fatality, the
judge held the scales of justice, where whilome the usurer had
poised his balance.</p>
<p>The palace forms three sides of a quadrangle. The fourth is
occupied by an embattled wall and an elaborate gate-way. The
building was erected about the beginning of the sixteenth century;
and, with all its faults, it is a fine adaptation of Gothic
architecture to civil purposes. It is in the style which a friend
of mine chooses to distinguish by the name of <i>Burgundian
architecture</i>; and <a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;192]</span></a>he tells me that he considers
it as the parent of our Tudor style. Here, the windows in the body
of the building take flattened elliptic heads; and they are divided
by one mullion and one transom. The mouldings are highly wrought,
and enriched with foliage. The lucarne windows are of a different
design, and form the most characteristic feature of the front: they
are pointed and enriched with mullions and tracery, and are placed
within triple canopies of nearly the same form, flanked by square
pillars, terminating in tall crocketed pinnacles, some of them
fronted with open arches crowned with statues. The roof, as is
usual in French and Flemish buildings of this date, is of a very
high pitch, and harmonizes well with the proportions of the
building. An oriel, or rather tower, of enriched workmanship
projects into the court, and varies the elevations. On the
left-hand side of the court, a wide flight of steps leads to the
hall called <i>la Salle des Procureurs</i>, a place originally
designed as an Exchange for the merchants of the city, who had
previously been in the habit of assembling for that purpose in the
cathedral. It is one hundred and sixty feet in length, by fifty in
breadth.</p>
<p>"In this great hall," says Peter Heylin, "are the seats and
desks of the procurators; every one's name written in capital
letters over his head. These procurators are like our attornies;
they prepare causes, and make them ready for the advocates. In this
hall do suitors use, either to attend on, or to walk up and down,
and confer with, their pleaders."&#8212;The attornies had similar
seats in the ancient English courts of justice; and these seats
still remain in the hall at Westminster, in which the <a name=
"Page_193" id="Page_193"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;193]</span></a>Court of Exchequer holds its
sittings. The walls of the Salle des Procureurs are adorned with
chaste niches. The coved roof is of timber, plain and bold, and
destitute either of the open tie-beams and arches, or the knot-work
and cross timber which adorn our old English roofs. If the roof of
our priory church was not ornamented, as last mentioned, it would
nearly resemble that in question.&#8212;Below the hall is a prison;
to its right is the room where the parliament formerly held its
sittings, but which is now appropriated to the trial of criminal
causes. The unfortunate Mathurin Bruneau, the soi-disant dauphin,
was last year tried here, and condemned to imprisonment. He is
treated in his place of confinement with ambiguous kindness. The
poor wretch loves his bottle; and, being allowed to intoxicate
himself to his heart's content, he is already reduced to a state of
idiotism.&#8212;Heylin, who saw the building when it was in
perfection, says, speaking of this <i>Great Chamber</i>, "that it
is so gallantly and richly built, that I must needs confess it
surpasseth all the rooms that ever I saw in my life. The palace of
the Louvre hath nothing in it comparable; the ceiling is all inlaid
with gold, yet doth the workmanship exceed the matter."&#8212;The
ceiling which excited Heylin's admiration still exists. It is a
grand specimen of the interior decoration of the times. The oak,
which age has rendered almost as dark as ebony, is divided into
compartments, covered with rich but whimsical carving, and relieved
with abundance of gold. Over the bench is a curious old picture, a
<i>Crucifixion</i>. Joseph and the Virgin are standing by the
cross: the figures are <a name="Page_194" id=
"Page_194"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;194]</span></a>painted
on a gold ground; the colors deep and rich; the drawing,
particularly in the arms, indifferent; the expression of the faces
good. It was upon this picture that witnesses took the oaths before
the revolution; and it is the only one of the six formerly in this
situation that escaped destruction<a name="FNanchor105" id=
"FNanchor105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a>.
Round the apartment are gnomic sentences in letters of gold,
reminding judges, juries, witnesses, and suitors, of their duties.
The room itself is said to be the most beautiful in France for its
proportions and quantity of light. In the <i>Antiquit&#233;s
Nationales</i>, is described and figured an elaborately wrought
chimney-piece in the council-chamber, now destroyed, as are some
fine Gothic door-ways, which opened into the chamber. The ceiling
of the apartment called la <i>seconde Chambre des
Enqu&#234;tes</i>, painted by Jouvenet, with a representation of
Jupiter hurling his thunderbolts at Vice, is also unfortunately no
more. It fell in, from a failure in the woodwork of the roof, on
the first of April, 1812. It was among the most highly-esteemed
productions of this master, and not the less remarkable for having
been executed with the left hand, after a paralytic stroke had
deprived him of the use of the other.</p>
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;195]</span></a>
<p>Millin observes, with much justice, that one of the most
remarkable of the decrees that issued from this palace, was that
which authorized the meetings of the <i>Conards</i>, a name given
to a confraternity of buffoons, who, disguised in grotesque
dresses, performed farces in the streets on Shrove Tuesday and
other holidays. Nor is it a little indicative of the taste of the
times, that men of rank, character, and respectability entered into
this society, the members of which, amounting to two thousand five
hundred, elected from among themselves a president, whom they
dressed as an abbot<a name="FNanchor106" id=
"FNanchor106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a>,
with a crozier and mitre, and, placing him on a car drawn by four
horses, led him, thus attired, in great pomp through the streets;
the whole of <a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;196]</span></a> the party being masked, and
personating not only the allegorical characters of avarice, lust,
&amp;c. but the more tangible ones of pope, king, and emperor, and
with them those of holy writ. The seat of this guild was at Notre
Dame de Bonnes Nouvelles.</p>

<p>In the cathedral itself the more notorious <i>Procession des

ass played the principal part, and the choir joined in the
hymn<a name="FNanchor107" id="FNanchor107"></a><a href=

<p>These, or similar ceremonies, call them if you please
absurdities, or call them impieties, (you will in neither case be
far from their proper name,) were in the early ages of Christianity
tolerated in almost every place. Mr. Douce has furnished us with
some curious remarks upon them in the eleventh volume of the
<i>Archaeologia</i>, and Mr. Ellis in his new edition of <i>Brand's
Popular Antiquities</i>. I am indebted to the first of these
gentlemen for the knowledge that the inclosed etching, copied some
time ago from a drawing by Mr. Joseph Harding, is allusive to the
ceremony of the <i>feast of fools</i>, and does not represent a
group of morris-dancers, as I had erroneously supposed. Indeed, Mr.
Douce believes that many of the strange carvings on the
<i>misereres</i> in our cathedrals have references to these
practices. And yet, to the honor of England, they never appear to
have been equally common <a name="Page_197" id=
"Page_197"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;197]</span></a>with us
as in France.&#8212;According to Du Cange<a name="FNanchor108" id=
"FNanchor108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a>, the
confraternity of the Conards or Cornards was confined to Rouen and
Evreux. I have not been able to ascertain when they were
suppressed; but they certainly existed in the time of Taillepied,
in the beginning of the seventeenth century, about fifty years
previously to which they dropped their original name of
<i>Coqueluchers</i>. At this time too they had evidently
degenerated from the primary object of their institution, "ridendo
castigare mores atque in omne quod turpit&#232;r factum fuerat
ridiculum immittere." Taillepied was an eye-witness of their
practices; and he prudently contents himself with saying; "le fait
est plus clair &#224; le voir que je ne pourrois icy
l'escrire."</p>
<p>At a short distance from the palace is a small square, called
the <i>Place de la Pucelle</i>, a name which it has but recently
acquired, in lieu of the more familiar appellation of <i>le
March&#233; aux Veaux</i>. The present title records one of the
most interesting events in the history of Rouen, the execution of
the unfortunate Joan of Arc, which is said to have taken place on
the very spot now covered by the monument that commemorates her
fate. Three different ones have in succession occupied this place.
The first was a cross, erected in 1454, only twenty-four years
after her death; for even at this early period, the King of France
had obtained from Pope Calixtus IIIrd, a bull directing the
revision of her sentence, and he had caused her innocence to be
acknowledged. The second was a fountain of delicate workmanship,
consisting of <a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;198]</span></a>three tiers of columns placed
one above the other, on a triangular plan, the whole decorated with
arabesques and statues of saints, while the Maid herself crowned
the summit, and the water flowed through pipes that terminated in
horses' heads. The present monument is inferior to the second,
equally in design and in workmanship: it is a plain triangular
pedestal, ornamented with dolphins at the base, and surmounted by
the heroine in military costume. Of the two last, figures are given
by Millin<a name="FNanchor109" id="FNanchor109"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a>, who could not be expected to
suffer a subject to escape him, so calculated for the gratification
of national pride. In a preceding volume of the same work<a name=
"FNanchor110" id="FNanchor110"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a>, he has represented the
monument erected to her memory by Charles VIIth, upon the bridge at
Orleans: the latter is commemorative of her triumphs; that at
Rouen, only of her capture and death. But the King testified his
gratitude by more substantial tokens: he ennobled her three
brothers and their descendants; and even allowed the females of the
family to confer their rank upon the persons whom they married, a
privilege which they continued to enjoy till the time of Louis
XIIIth, who abolished it in 1634.</p>
<p>In the square is a house within a court, now occupied as a
school for girls, of the same &#230;ra as the Palais de Justice,
and in the same <i>Burgundian style</i>, but far richer in its
sculptures. The entire front is divided into compartments by
slender and lengthened buttresses and pilasters. The intervening
spaces are filled with basso-relievos, <a name="Page_199" id=
"Page_199"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;199]</span></a>evidently executed at one
period, though by different masters. A banquet beneath a window in
the first floor, is in a good <i>cinque-cento</i> style. Others of
the basso-relievos, represent the labors of the field and the
vineyard; rich and fanciful in their costume, but rather wooden in
their design: the Salamander, the emblem of Francis Ist, appears
several times amongst the ornaments, and very conspicuously. I
believe there is not a single square foot of this extraordinary
building, which has not been sculptured.&#8212;On the north side
extends a spacious gallery. Here the architecture is rather in
Holbein's manner: foliaged and swelling pilasters, like antique
candelabra, bound the arched windows. Beneath, is the well-known
series of bas-reliefs, executed on marble tablets, representing the
interview between Francis Ist of France, and Henry VIIIth of
England, in the <i>Champ du Drap d'or</i>, between Guisnes and
Ardres. They were first discovered by the venerable father
Montfaucon, who engraved them in his <i>Monumens de la Monarchie
Fran&#231;aise</i><a name="FNanchor111" id=
"FNanchor111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a>; but
to the greater part of our antiquaries at home, they are, perhaps,
more commonly known by the miserable copies inserted in Ducarel's
work, who has borrowed most of his plates from the
Benedictine.&#8212;These sculptures are much mutilated, and so
obscured by smoke and dirt, that the details cannot be understood
without great difficulty. The corresponding tablets above the
windows, are even in a worse condition; and they appear to have
been almost unintelligible in the time of Montfaucon, who
conjectures that they were allegorical, <a name="Page_200" id=
"Page_200"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;200]</span></a> and
probably intended to represent the triumph of religion. Each tablet
contains a triumphal car, drawn by different animals, one by
elephants, another by lions, and so on, and crowded with
mythological figures and attributes.&#8212;A friend of mine, who
examined them this summer, tells me, that he thinks the subjects
are either <i>taken</i> from the triumphs of Petrarch, or
<i>imitated</i> from the triumphs introduced in the
<i>Polifilo</i>. Graphic representations of allegories are
susceptible of so many variations, that an artist, embodying the
ideas of the poet, might produce a representation bearing a close
resemblance to the mythological processions of the mystic
dream.&#8212;Of one of the most perfect of the historical subjects,
I send you a drawing: it is the first in order in Montfaucon's
work, and exhibits the suite of the King of England, on their way
from the town of Guisnes, to meet the French monarch. Two of the
figures might be mistaken for Henry himself and Wolsey, riding
familiarly side by side; but these dignified personages have more
important parts allotted them in the second and third compartments,
where they appear in the full-blown honors of their respective
characters.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_24" id="plate_24"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_24.png" height="334" width="800" alt=
"Bas-Relief, from the representations of the Champ du Drap d'or" /></p>
<p>The interior has been modernized; so that a beam covered with
small carvings is the only remaining object of curiosity. On the
top, a bunch of leaden thistles has been a sad puzzle to
antiquaries, who would fain find some connection between the
building and Scotland; but neither record nor tradition throw any
light upon their researches. Montfaucon, copying from a manuscript
written by the Abb&#233; Noel, says, "I have more than once been
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;201]</span></a>told that Francis Ist, on his
way through Rouen, lodged at this house; and it is most probable,
that the bas-reliefs in question were made upon some of these
occasions, to gratify the king by the representation of a festival,
in which he particularly delighted." The gallery sculptures are
very fine, and the upper tier is much in the style of Jean Goujon.
It is not generally known that Goujon re-drew the embellishments of
Beroald de Verville's translation of the Polifilo; and that these,
beautiful as they are in the Aldine edition, acquired new graces
from the French artist.&#8212;I have remarked that the allegorical
tablets appear to coincide with the designs of the Polifilo: a more
accurate examination might, perhaps, prove the fact; and then
little doubt would remain. The building is much dilapidated; and,
unless speedily repaired, these basso-relievos, which would adorn
any museum, will utterly perish. In spite of neglect and
degradations, the aspect of the mansion is still such that, as my
friend observed, one would expect to see a fair and stately matron
standing in the porch, attired in velvet, waiting to receive her
lord.&#8212;In the adjoining house, once, probably, a part of the
same, but now an inn, bearing the sign of <i>la Pucelle</i>, is
shewn a circular room, much ornamented, with a handsome oriel
conspicuous on the outside. In this apartment, the Maid is said to
have been tried; but it is quite certain that not a stone of the
building was then put of the quarry.</p>
<p>Hence I must take you, and still under the auspices of
Millin<a name="FNanchor112" id="FNanchor112"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a>, to the great town-clock, or,
as it is here called, <a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;202]</span></a><i>la Tour de la Grosse
Horloge</i>; and I cannot help wishing on the occasion, that I had
half the powers of instructing and amusing which he possessed. Like
the writers in our most popular Reviews, he uses the subjects which
he places at the head of his articles as little more than a peg,
whereon to hang whatever he knows connected with the matter; and
the result is, that he is never read without pleasure or
information. Such is peculiarly the case in the present instance,
in which he takes an opportunity of giving the history of the
origin of clocks, tracing them from the simple dial, and
particularising the most curious and intricate contrivances of
modern ingenuity. Another name of the tower which contains this
clock, is <i>la Tour du Beffroi</i>, or, as we should say in
English, the <i>Belfry</i>; for the two words have the same
meaning, and it is not to be doubted but that they originated from
the same root, the Anglo-Saxon <i>bell</i>, whence barbarous
Latinists have formed <i>Belfredus</i> and <i>Berfredus</i>, terms
for moveable towers used in sieges, and so denominated from their
resemblance in form to bell-towers. I mention this etymology,
because the French have misled themselves strangely on the subject;
and one of them has wandered so widely in his conjectures, as to
derive <i>beffroi</i> from <i>bis effroi</i>, supposing it to be
the cause of double alarm! Happily, in the most alarming of all
times for France, that of the revolution, this bell, though
appointed the <i>tocsin</i>, had scarcely ever occasion to sound.
There is, however, another purpose, alarming at all periods, and
especially in a town built of wood, to which it is appropriated,
and to which we only <a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;203]</span></a>yesterday heard it applied, the
ringing to announce a fire. The precautions taken against similar
accidents in Rouen, are excellent, and they had need be so; for
insurance-companies of any kind are unknown, I believe, in
France<a name="FNanchor113" id="FNanchor113"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a>, or exist only upon a most
limited scale, at the foot of the Pyrenees, where the farmers
mutually insure each other against the effects of the hail. The
daily office of this bell is to sound the curfew, a practice which,
under different names, is still kept up through Normandy. Here it
rings nightly at nine. In other towns it rings at nine in winter
only, but not till ten in summer. In some places it is called <i>la
retraite</i>.</p>
<p>Adjoining the bell-tower is a fountain, ornamented with statues
of Alpheus and Arethusa, united by Cupid; a specimen of the taste
of the far-famed <i>si&#232;cles de Louis XIV et de Louis XV</i>,
and a worthy companion of the water-works at Versailles. There are
in Rouen more than thirty public fountains, all supplied by five
different springs, among which, those of Yonville and of
Darn&#233;tal are accounted to afford the purest water.&#8212;The
Robec and the Aubette also flow through Rouen in artificial
channels. St. Louis granted them both to the city in 1262; but it
was the great benefactor of the place, the Cardinal d'Amboise, who
brought them within the walls, by means of a canal, which he caused
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;204]</span></a>to be dug at his own expence.
For a space of two leagues their banks are uninterruptedly lined
with mills and manufactories of various descriptions; and it is
this circumstance which has given rise to the saying, that Rouen is
a wonderful place, for "that it has a river with three hundred
bridges, and whose waters change their color ten times a day."</p>
<p>As a building, the fountain of Lisieux, decorated with a
bas-relief representing Parnassus, with Apollo, the Muses, and
Pegasus, is most frequently pointed out to strangers; a wretched
specimen of wretched taste. Infinitely more interesting to us are
the Gothic fountains or conduits, which are now wholly wanting in
England. Such is the fountain <i>de la Croix de Pierre</i>, which,
in shape, style, and ornaments, resembles the monumental crosses
erected by; our King Edward Ist, for his Queen Eleanor. The water
flows from pipes in the basement. The stone statues, which filled
the tabernacles, were destroyed during the revolution: they have
been replaced by others in wood.&#8212;The fountain <i>de la
Crosse</i> is of inferior size, and more recent date. It is a
polygon, with sides of pannelled work, each compartment occupied by
a pointed arch, with tracery in the spandrils. It ends in a short
truncated pyramid, which, in Millin's time, was surmounted by a
royal crown<a name="FNanchor114" id="FNanchor114"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a>. Its name is taken from a
house, at whose corner it stands, and on whose roof was originally
a crozier.</p>

<p>Writing to a friend may be regarded, if we extend to writing the
happy comparison which Lord Bacon has applied to conversation, not
as walking in a high-road which leads direct to a house, but rather
as strolling through a country intersected with a variety of paths,
in which the traveller wanders as fancy or accident directs. Hence
I shall scarcely apologize for my abrupt transition to another very
different subject, the hospitals.&#8212;There are at Rouen two such
establishments, situated at opposite extremes of the town, the
<i>Hospice G&#233;n&#233;ral</i> and the <i>H&#244;tel Dieu</i>,
more commonly called <i>la Madeleine</i>. The latter is
appropriated only to the sick; the former is also open to the aged,
to foundlings, to paupers, and to lunatics. For the poor, I have
been able to hear of no other provision; and poor-laws, as you
know, have no existence in France; yet, even here, in a
manufacturing town, and at a season of distress, beggary is far
from extreme. These institutions, like all the rest at Rouen, are
said to be under excellent management.</p>
<p>The annual expences of la Madeleine are estimated at two hundred
and forty thousand-francs<a name="FNanchor115" id=
"FNanchor115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a>; out
of which sum, no less than forty-seven thousand francs are expended
in bread. The number of individuals admitted here, during the first
nine months of 1805, the last authentic statement I have been able
to procure, was two thousand seven hundred and seventeen: during
the same period, two thousand one hundred and fifty-eight were
discharged, and two hundred and seventy died. The building is
modern and handsome, <a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;206]</span></a>and situated at the end of a
fine avenue. The church, a Corinthian edifice, and indisputably the
handsomest building of that description at Rouen, is generally
admired. The Hospice G&#233;n&#233;ral, destitute as it is of
architectural magnificence, cannot be visited without satisfaction.
When I was at this hospital, the old men who are housed there were
seated at their dinner, and I have seldom witnessed a more pleasing
sight. They exhibited an appearance of cleanliness, propriety, good
order, and comfort, equally creditable to themselves and to the
institution. The number of inmates usually resident in this
building is about two thousand; and they consisted, in 1805, of one
hundred and sixty aged men, one hundred and eighty aged women, six
hundred children, and eight hundred and twenty-five invalids. Among
the latter were forty lunatics. The food here allowed to the
helpless poor is of good quality; and, as far as I could learn, is
afforded in sufficient quantity: there are also two work-shops; in
one of which, articles are manufactured for the use of the house;
in the other, for sale.</p>
<p>The principal towns of France, as was anciently the case in
England, have each its mint. The numismatic antiquities of this
kingdom are yet involved in considerable obscurity; but it is said
that the monetary privileges of the towns were first settled by
Charles the Bald<a name="FNanchor116" id="FNanchor116"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a>, who, about the year 835,
enacted, that money, which had previously only been coined in the
royal palace itself, or in places where the sovereign was present,
should be struck in future at Paris, Rouen, Rheims, Sens, Chalons
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;207]</span></a>sur Saone, Mesle in Poitou, and
Narbonne. At present, the money struck at Rouen is impressed with
the letter <i>B</i>, indicating that the mint is second only to
that of Paris; for the city has remained in possession of the right
of coinage throughout all its various changes of masters: it now
holds it in common with ten other, cities in the kingdom.
Ducarel<a name="FNanchor117" id="FNanchor117"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> has figured two very scarce
silver pennies, coined here by William the Conqueror, before the
invasion of England; and Snelling and Ruding<a name="FNanchor118"
id="FNanchor118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a>
detail ordinances for the regulation of the mintage of Rouen,
during the reign of Henry Vth. I have not been able, however, to
procure in the city any specimens of these, or of other Norman
coins; and in fact the native spot of articles of <i>virtu</i> is
seldom the place where they can be procured either genuine or in
abundance. Greek medals, I am told, are regularly exported from
Birmingham to Athens, for the supply of our travelled gentlemen;
and, if groats and pennies should ever rise in the market, I doubt
not but that they will find their way in plenty into the old towns
of Normandy. There is not, at Rouen, any public collection of the
productions of the mint. Since the annexation of the duchy to the
crown of France, no coins have been struck here, except the common
silver currency of the kingdom: the manufacture of medals and of
gold coins is exclusively the privilege of the Parisian mint. The
establishment is under the care of a commissary and assay-master,
appointed by the crown, but not salaried. Their pay depends upon
the amount of money coined, <a name="Page_208" id=
"Page_208"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;208]</span></a>on which
they are allowed one and a half per cent., and are left to find
silver where they can; so that, in effect, it is little more than a
private concern. The work is performed by four die-presses, moved
by levers, each of which requires ten men; and about twenty
thousand pieces can be produced daily from each press. But this
method of working is attended with unequal pressure, and causes
both trouble and uncertainty: it is even necessary that each coin
should be separately weighed. The extreme superiority of the
machinery of our own mint, where the whole operation is performed
by steam, with a rapidity and accuracy altogether astonishing,
affords Just reason for exultation to an Englishman.&#8212;It is
true, that the execution of our bank paper rather counterbalances
such feelings of complacency.</p>

<h2>LETTER XIII.</h2>
<h4>MONASTIC
INSTITUTIONS&#8212;LIBRARY&#8212;MANUSCRIPTS&#8212;MUSEUM&#8212;ACADEMY&#8212;BOTANIC
GARDEN&#8212;THEATRE&#8212;ANCIENT HISTORY&#8212;EMINENT MEN.</h4>
<p class="r">(<i>Rouen, June</i>, 1818.)</p>
<p>The laws of France do not recognize monastic vows; but of late
years, the clergy have made attempts to re-establish the
communities which once characterized the Catholic church. To a
certain degree they have succeeded: the spirit of religion is
stronger than the law; and the spirit of contradiction, which
teaches the subject to do whatever the law forbids, is stronger
than either. Hence, most towns in France contain establishments,
which may be considered either as the embers of expiring monachism,
or the sparks of its reviving flame. Rouen has now a convent of
Ursulines, who undertake the education of young females. The house
is spacious; and for its neatness, as well as for the appearance of
regularity and propriety, cannot be surpassed. On this account, it
is often visited by strangers. The present lady-abbess, Dame
Cousin, would do honor to the most flourishing days of the
hierarchy: when she walks into the chapel, Saint Ethelburgha
herself could not have carried the crozier with greater state; and,
though she is somewhat short and somewhat thick, her pupils are all
wonderfully edified by her dignity. She has upwards of dozen
English heretics under her care; but she will not compromise her
conscience by allowing them to attend the Protestant service. There
are also about ninety French scholars, and the inborn antipathy
between them and the <a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;210]</span></a><i>insulaires</i>, will
sometimes evince itself. Amongst other specimens of girlish spite,
the French fair-ones have divided the English damsels into two
<i>genera</i>. Those who look plump and good-humored, they call
<i>Mesdemoiselles Rosbifs</i>; whilst such as are thin and graver
acquire the appellation of the <i>Mesdemoiselles Goddams</i>, a
name by which we have been known in France, at least five centuries
ago.&#8212;This story is not trivial, for it bespeaks the national
feeling; and, although you may not care much about it, yet I am
sure, that five centuries hence, it will be considered as of
infinite importance by the antiquaries who are now babes unborn.
The Ursulines and <i>s&#339;urs d'Ernemon</i>, or <i>de la
Charit&#233;</i>, who nurse the sick, are the only two orders which
are now protected by government. They were even encouraged under
the reign of Napol&#233;on, who placed them under the care of his
august parent, <i>Madame M&#232;re</i>.&#8212;There are other
sisterhoods at Rouen, though in small numbers, and not publickly
patronized.</p>
<p>Nuns are thus increasing and multiplying, but monks and friars
are looked upon with a more jealous eye; and I have not heard that
any such communities have been allowed to re-assemble within the
limits of the duchy, once so distinguished for their opulence, and,
perhaps, for their piety and learning.</p>
<p>The libraries of the monasteries were wasted, dispersed, and
destroyed, during the revolution; but the wrecks have since been
collected in the principal towns; and thus originated the public
library of Rouen, which now contains, as it is said, upwards of
seventy thousand volumes. As may be anticipated, a great proportion
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;211]</span></a>of the works which it includes
relate to theology and scholastic divinity; and the Bollandists
present their formidable front of fifty-four ponderous folios.</p>
<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_25" id="plate_25"></a><br />
<img src="images/plate_25.png" height="402" width="293" alt=
"Initial Letter from a MS. of the History of William of Jumieges" />
</p>
<p>The manuscripts, of which I understand there are full eight
hundred, are of much greater value than the printed books. But they
are at present unarranged and uncatalogued, though M. Licquet, the
librarian, has been for some time past laboring to bring them into
order. Among those pointed out to us, none interested me so much as
an original autograph; of the <i>Historica Normannorum</i>, by
William de Jumiegies, brought from the very abbey to which he
belonged. There is no doubt, I believe, of its antiquity; but, to
enable you to form your own judgment upon the subject, I send you a
tracing of the first paragraph.</p>
<p class="ctr"><img src="images/picture_07.png" height="221" width=
"356" alt="Historica Normannorum tracing of autograph" /></p>
<p>I also add a fac-simile of the initial letter of the foregoing
epistle, illuminated by the monk, and in which he <a name=
"Page_212" id="Page_212"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;212]</span></a>has introduced himself in the
act of humbly presenting his work to his royal namesake. I am
mistaken, if any equally early, and equally well authenticated
representation of a King of England be in existence. The
<i>Historia Normannorum</i> is incomplete, both at the beginning
and end, and it does not occupy more than one-fifth of the volume:
the rest is filled with a comment upon the Jewish History.</p>
<p>The articles among the manuscripts, most valued by antiquaries,
are a <i>Benedictionary</i> and a <i>Missal</i>, both supposed of
nearly the same date, the beginning of the twelfth century.</p>
<p>The Abb&#233; Saas, who published, in 1746, a catalogue of the
manuscripts belonging to the library of the cathedral of Rouen,
calls this Benedictionary, which then belonged to the metropolitan
church, a <i>Penitential</i>; and gives it as his opinion, that it
is a production of the eighth century, with which &#230;ra he says
that the character of the writing wholly accords. Montfaucon, who
never saw it, follows the Abb&#233;; but the opinion of these
learned men has recently been confuted by M. Gourdin<a name=
"FNanchor119" id="FNanchor119"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a>, who has bestowed considerable
pains upon the elucidation of the history and contents of this
curious relic. He states that a sum of fifteen thousand francs had
been offered for it, by a countryman of our own; but I should not
hesitate to class this tale among the numberless idle reports which
are current upon the continent, respecting the riches and the folly
of English <a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;213]</span></a>travellers. The famous Bedford
Missal, at a time when the bibliomania was at its height<a name=
"FNanchor120" id="FNanchor120"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a>, could hardly fetch a larger
sum; and this of Rouen is in no point of view, except antiquity, to
be put in competition with the English manuscript. Its
illuminations are certainly beautiful; but they are equalled by
many hundreds of similar works; and they are only three in number,
the <i>Resurrection</i>, the <i>Descent of the Holy Ghost</i>, and
the <i>Death of the Virgin</i>.&#8212;The volume appears to have
been originally designed for the use of the cathedral of
Canterbury; as it contains the service used at the consecration of
our Anglo-Saxon sovereigns.</p>
<p>The Missal, which is also the object of M. Gourdin's
dissertation, is from the convent of Jumieges. Its date is
established by the circumstance of the paschal table finishing with
the year 1095. It contains eleven miniatures, <a name="Page_214"
id="Page_214"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;214]</span></a>inferior in execution to those
in the Benedictionary; and it ends with the following anathema, in
the hand-writing of the Abbot Robert, by whom it was given to the
monastery:&#8212;"Quem si quis vi vel dolo seu quoque modo isti
loco subtraxerit, anim&#230; su&#230; propter quod fecerit
detrimentum patiatur, atque de libro viventium deleatur et cum
justis non scribatur."</p>
<p>As a memorial of a usage almost universal in the earlier ages of
the church, the <i>Diptych</i>, commonly called the <i>Livre
d'Ivoire</i>, is a valuable relic. The covers exhibit figures of
St. Peter and of some other saint, in a good style of workmanship,
perhaps of the lower empire. The book contains the oaths
administered to each archbishop of Rouen and his suffragans, upon
their entering on their office, all of them severally subscribed by
the individuals by whom they were sworn. It begins at a very early
period, and finishes with the name of Julius Basilius Ferronde de
la Ferronaye, consecrated Bishop of Lisieux, in 1784. In the first
page is the formula of the oath of the
archbishop.&#8212;"Juramentum Archiepiscopi Rothomagensis jucundo

donante, me facturum promitto.&#8212;Iterum Decanus vel
alius;&#8212;Firma juramento qu&#230; te facturum

"pagenum">[Page&#160;215]</span></a>personas ipsius invasores et
oppressores pro posse protegam viriliter et defendam, atque etiam
ipsius ecclesi&#230; jura, libertates, privilegia, statuta et
consuetudines apostolicas servabo fideliter. Bona ejusdem
ecclesi&#230; non alienabo nec alienari permittam, quin pro posse,
si qu&#230; alienata fuerint, revocabo. Sic me Deus adjuvet et
sancta Dei evangelia."</p>
<p>The oath of the bishops and abbots was nothing more than a
promise of constant respect and obedience on their parts to the
church and archbishop of Rouen. You will find it in the <i>Voyages
Liturgiques</i><a name="FNanchor121" id="FNanchor121"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a>; in which you will also meet
with a great deal of curious matter touching the peculiar customs
and ceremonies of this cathedral. The different metropolitan
churches of France before the revolution, like those of our own
country prior to the reformation, varied materially from one
another in observances of minor importance; at the same time that
their rituals all agreed in what may be termed the doctrinal
ceremonies of the church.</p>
<p>The last manuscript which I shall mention, is the only one that
is commonly shewn to strangers: it is a <i>Graduel</i>, a very
large folio volume, written in the seventeenth century, and of
transcendent beauty. Julio Clovio himself, the Raphael of this
department of art, might have <a name="Page_216" id=
"Page_216"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;216]</span></a>been
proud to be considered the author of the miniatures in it. The
representations of lapis lazuli are even more wonderful than the
flowers and insects. The whole was done by a monk, of the name of
Daniel D'Eaubonne, and is said to have cost him the labor of his
entire life.</p>
<p>In earlier times, a similar occupation was regarded as
peculiarly meritorious<a name="FNanchor122" id=
"FNanchor122"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a>.&#8212;There died a friar, a
man of irregular life, and his soul was brought before the
judgment-seat to receive its deserts. The evil spirits attended,
not anticipating any opposition to the claim which they preferred;
but the guardian angels produced a large book, filled with a
transcript from holy writ by the hand of the criminal; and it was
at length agreed that each letter in it should be allowed to stand
against a sin. The tale was carefully gone through: Satan exerted
his utmost ingenuity to substantiate every crime of omission or
commission; and the contending parties kept equal pace, even unto
the last letter of the last word of the last line of the last page,
when, happily for the monk, the recollection of his accuser failed,
and not a single charge could be found to be placed in the balance
against it. His soul was therefore again remanded to the body, and
a farther time was allotted to it to correct its evil
ways.&#8212;The legend is pointed by an apposite moral; for the
brethren are exhorted to "pray, read, sing, and write, always
bearing in mind, that one devil only is allowed to assail a monk
who is intent upon his duties, but that a thousand are let loose to
lead the idle into temptation."</p>
<p>The library is open every day, except Sundays and Thursdays,
from ten to two, to everybody who chooses <a name="Page_217" id=
"Page_217"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;217]</span></a>to
enter. It is to the credit of the inhabitants of Rouen, that they
avail themselves of the privilege; and the room usually contains a
respectable assemblage of persons of all classes. The revenue of
the library does not amount to more than three thousand francs per
annum; but it is also occasionally assisted by government. The
French ministers of state consider that it is the interest of the
nation to promote the publication of splendid works, either by
pecuniary grants to the authors, or, as more commonly happens, by
subscribing for a number of copies, which they distribute amongst
the public libraries of the kingdom.&#8212;I could say a great deal
upon the difference in the conduct of the governments of France and
England in this respect, but it would be out of place; and I trust
that our House of Commons will not be long before they expunge from
the statute-books, a law which, under the shameless pretence of
"encouraging learning," is in fact a disgrace to the country.</p>
<p>The museum is also established at the H&#244;tel-de-Ville, where
it occupies a long gallery and a room adjoining. It is under the
superintendence of M. Descamps, son of the author of two very
useful works, <i>La Vie des Peintres Flamands</i> and <i>Le Voyage
Pittoresque</i>. The father was born at Dunkirk, in 1714, but lived
principally at Paris, till an accidental circumstance fixed him at
Rouen, in 1740. On his way to England, he here formed an
acquaintance with M. de Cideville, the friend of Voltaire, who,
anxious for the honor of his native town, persuaded the young
artist to select it as the place of his future residence. The event
fully answered his expectation; for the ability and zeal of M.
Descamps soon gave new life <a name="Page_218" id=
"Page_218"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;218]</span></a>to the
arts at Rouen. A public academy of painting was formed under his
auspices, to which he afforded gratuitous instruction; and its
celebrity increased so rapidly, that the number of pupils soon
amounted to three hundred; and Norman authors continued to
anticipate in fancy the creation of a Norman school, which should
rival those of Bologna and Florence, until the very moment when the
revolution dispelled this day-dream. Descamps died at the close of
the last century. To his son, who inherits his parent's taste, with
no small portion of his talent, we were indebted for much obliging
attention.</p>
<p>The museum is open to the public on Sundays and Thursdays; but
daily to students and strangers. It contains upwards of two hundred
and thirty paintings. Of these, the great mass is undoubtedly by
French artists, comparatively little known and of small merit,
imitators of Poussin and Le Brun. Such paintings as bear the names
of the old Italian masters, are in general copies; some of them,
indeed, not bad imitations. Among them is one of the celebrated
Raphael, commonly called the <i>Madonna di San Sisto</i>, a very
beautiful copy, especially in the head of the virgin, and the
female saint on her left hand. It is esteemed one of his finest
pieces; but few of his pictures are less generally known: there is
no engraving of it in Landon's eight volumes of his works.</p>
<p>Looking to the unquestionable originals in the collection, there
are perhaps none of greater value than Jouvenet's finished sketches
for the dome of the H&#244;tel des Invalides, at Paris. They
represent the twelve apostles, each with his symbol, and are
extremely well composed, with a bold system of light and shadow.
The museum has five <a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;219]</span></a>other pictures by the same
master; in this number are his own portrait, a vigorous
performance, as well in point of character as of color; and the
<i>Death of St. Francis</i>, which has generally been considered
one of his happiest works. Both these were painted with his left
hand. The death of St. Francis is said to have been his first
attempt at using the brush, after he was affected with paralysis,
and to have been done by way of model for his scholar, Restout,
whom he had desired to execute the same subject for him. A
<i>Christ bearing his Cross</i>, by Polemburg; is a little piece of
high finish and considerable merit; an <i>Ecce Homo</i>, by
Mignard, is excellent; and a <i>St. Francis in Extasy</i>, by
Annibal Caracci, is a good illustration of the true character of
the Bolognese school: it is a fine and dignified picture, depending
for its excellence upon a grand character of expression and
drawing, and light and shade, and not at all on bright or varied
coloring, to which it makes no pretension.</p>
<p>As local curiosities, the attention of the amateur should be
devoted to the productions of the painters to whom Rouen has given
birth, Restout, Lemonnier, Deshays, Leger, Houel, Letellier, and
Sacquesp&#233;e, artists, not of the first class, but of sufficient
merit to do great credit to the exhibition of a provincial
metropolis.</p>
<p>From these recent specimens, you would turn with the more
pleasure to a picture by Van Eyck, the inventor, as it is generally
supposed, of oil painting. Let us respect these fathers of the art.
Let us pardon the stiffness of their composition, the formality of
their figures, the inelegance of their draperies, the hardness of
their outlines, and the want of chiaroscuro;&#8212;for, in spite of
all <a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;220]</span></a>these failings, there is a
truth to nature, and a richness of coloring, which always attract
and win. The picture in question is the <i>Virgin Mother in her
Domestic Retirement</i>, surrounded by her family, a comely party
of young females in splendid attire, some of them wearing the
bridal crown. It is altogether a curiosity, partaking, indeed, of
the general bad taste of the times, but painted with great
attention to nature in the minuti&#230;, and resembling Lionardo da
Vinci in many particulars, especially in the high finishing, the
coloring of the carnations, and the grace, and beauty of some of
the heads. The draperies, too, are rich and brilliant.</p>
<p>This museum is a recent erection: most, if not all, of the
departments of France, possess similar establishments in their
principal towns. The basis of the collection is founded upon the
plunder of the suppressed monasteries; but M. Descamps told us
that, in the course of a journey to Italy, he had been the means of
adding to this, at Rouen, its principal ornaments. He had the
greater merit of preserving it entire, when orders were transmitted
from Paris to send off its best pictures, to replace those taken
from the Louvre by the allies; for on all occasions, whether great
or small, the interests of the departments are sacrificed without
mercy to the engulphing capital. Descamps was firm in defending his
trust: he resisted the spoliation, upon the principle that the
museum was the private property of the town; and the plea was
admitted.</p>
<p>The same conventual buildings also contain the rooms
appropriated to the use of the academy at Rouen, a royal
institution of old standing, and which has published fifteen
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;221]</span></a>volumes of its
transactions.&#8212;It was founded in 1744, under a charter granted
to the Duke of Luxembourg, then governor of the province, and its
first president. The present complement of members consists of
forty-six fellows, besides non-resident associates. Its meetings
are held every Friday evening, and the members, as at the institute
at Paris, read their own papers. A few nights ago, at a meeting of
this academy, I heard a memoir from the pen of the professor of
botany, in which he dwelt at large upon the family of the lilies,
but prized and praised them for nothing so much as for their
connection with the Bourbon family. I mention the fact to shew you
how readily the French seize hold of every occasion of displaying
their devotion to the powers that be. In 1814, at the moment of the
restoration of Louis XVIIIth, we were not surprised to see every
town and village between Calais and Paris, decorated with a proud
display of the busts of the monarch, the shields of France and
Navarre, and innumerable devices and mottoes, <i>consecrated</i>,
as the French say, to the Bourbons; but four years have given time
for this ebullition of loyalty to subside; and the introduction of
such topics at the present day, and especially in the meetings of a
body devoted solely to the improvement of literature and of the
arts and sciences, appears to savor somewhat of adulation. These
praises excited no remarks and no criticisms; though both might
have been expected; for, during the reading of a paper, the
by-standers are allowed to discuss its merits and its defects. This
practice gives the sittings of a French literary society a degree
of life and spirit wanting to ours in England; but I doubt if the
advantage be not more than <a name="Page_222" id=
"Page_222"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;222]</span></a>counter-balanced by the
frequent interruptions which it occasions, and which an ill-natured
person might in some cases suspect to proceed from a desire of
attracting notice, rather than from fair, and just reprehension. I
should be sorry to insinuate that any thing of this kind was
evident at the time, just alluded to, which was the Friday previous
to the annual meeting, the day appointed for taking into
consideration the report intended to be submitted to the full
assembly of the inhabitants. The president also read his projected
speech, in the course of which he took the opportunity of declaring
in strong terms his dislike to Napol&#233;on's plan of education,
directed almost exclusively to military affairs and mathematics: he
even stated that the present generation "&#233;toit sans
morale."&#8212;The opinion could not be allowed to pass: he found
himself beset on all sides; not an individual supported him; and
after a variety of attempts to palliate and explain away the
offensive passage, he was obliged to consent to expunge it. This
will give some farther idea of the state of public feeling in
France: the compliment upon the lilies passed as words of course;
but the same body that tolerated it, positively refused to stamp
with the sanction of their approbation, any comparison unfavorable
to the system of Napol&#233;on, when put in opposition to that of
the subsisting government.</p>
<p>There is another literary body at Rouen; called <i>la
Soci&#233;t&#233; d'Emulation</i>, of more recent establishment, it
having been founded in 1791. Conformably to the national spirit
which then prevailed, it is directed exclusively to the
encouragement of manufactories and agriculture.&#8212;This society
distributes annual medals as the reward of <a name="Page_223" id=
"Page_223"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;223]</span></a>improvements and discoveries,
though I am afraid that as yet it has been productive but of
slender utility.</p>
<p>Rouen also possesses a Botanic Garden, which was founded in
1738; but the scite which it now occupies was not thus applied till
twenty years subsequently, when the municipality conveyed the
ground in perpetuity to the academy in its corporate capacity,
stipulating that it should yield a nosegay every year as an
appropriate <i>rent in kind</i>. At the revolution a grant like
this would scarcely be respected; still less did the jacobins
appreciate the pleasures or advantages derived from the garden. The
demagogues of that period seem to have entered heartily into Jean
Jacques Rousseau's notions, that the arts and sciences were
injurious to mankind: this fine establishment was seized as
national property, and, according to the revolutionary jargon, was
<i>soumission&#233;</i>; but a more temporate faction obtained the
ascendancy before the sale was carried into effect.&#8212;The
collection is extensive, and the plants are in good order: I am not
however, aware that the city has ever given birth to any man of
eminence in this department of science. Lately, indeed, the
Abb&#233; Le Turquier Deslongchamps, a very well-informed botanist,
as well as a most excellent man, has published a <i>Flore des
Environs de Rouen</i>, in two volumes; and there are many instances
in which such works have been known to diffuse a taste, which
public gardens and the lectures of professors had in vain
endeavored to excite.</p>
<p>The variety of soil in the vicinity of the city renders it
eminently favorable to the study of botany. It is peculiarly rich
in the <i>Orchide&#230;</i> of the most beautiful and interesting
families of the vegetable kingdom. The curious <a name="Page_224"
id="Page_224"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&#160;224]</span></a><i>Satyrium hircinun</i> is
found in the utmost profusion upon the chalky hills immediately
adjoining the city; and, at but a few miles distance, in a
continuation of the same ridge, the bare chalk, under the romantic
hill of St. Adrien, is purpled with the flowers of the <i>Viola
Rothomagensis</i>, a plant scarcely known to exist in any other
place.</p>
<p>The suburbs of Rouen abound with nursery-grounds and gardens:
the former contribute greatly to the preservation of the genuine
stock of apple-trees, which furnish the cider, for which Normandy
has for many centuries been celebrated; the latter supply the
inhabitants with the flowers which are seen at almost every window.
The square in front of the cathedral is the principal
flower-market; and the bloom and luxuriance and variety of the
plants exposed for sale, render it a most pleasing promenade.
Various species of jessamines and roses, with oleanders,
pomegranates, myrtles, egg-plants, orange and lemon trees, the
<i>Lilium superbum</i> and <i>tigrinum</i>, <i>Canna Indica</i>,
<i>Gladiolus cardinalis</i>, <i>Clerodendrum fragrans</i>,
<i>Datura ceratocolla</i>, <i>Clethra alnifolia</i>, and
<i>Dianthus Carthusianorum</i>, are to be seen in the greatest
profusion and beauty. They at once attest the care of the
cultivators, and a climate more genial than ours. None of the
flowers, however, excited my envy so much as the <i>Rosa
moschata</i>, which grows here in the open air, and diffuses its
delicious fragrance from almost every window of the town.</p>
<p>It is perhaps to the credit of Rouen, that science and learning
appear to flourish more kindly than the drama. The theatre of Rouen
is quite uncharacteristic of the passion which the French usually
entertain for <i>spectacles</i>. <a name="Page_225" id=
"Page_225"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;225]</span></a>The
house is shabby; the audience, as often as we have been there, has
been small; and in this great city, the capital of an extensive,
populous, and wealthy district we have witnessed acting so
wretched, as would disgrace the floor of a village barn. We have
been much surprised by seeing the performers repeatedly laugh in
the face of the spectators, a thing which I should least of all
have expected in France, where usually, in similar cases, the whole
nation is tremblingly alive to the slightest violations of decorum.
And yet Corneille, the father of the French drama, was born in this
city: the scene that is used for a curtain at the theatre bears his
portrait, with the inscription, "<i>P. Corneille, natif de
Rouen</i>;" and his apotheosis is painted upon the cieling. These
recollections ought to tend to the improvement of the drama. The
portrait of the great tragedian is more appropriate than the busts
of Henry IVth and Louis XVIIIth, which occupy opposite sides of the
stage; the latter laurelled and flanked with small white flags,
whose staffs terminate in paper lilies.</p>
<p>Corneille and Fontenelle are the citizens, of whom Rouen is most
proud: the house in which Corneille was born, in the <i>Rue de la
Pie</i>, is still shewn to strangers. His bust adorns the entrance,
together with an inscription to his honor. The residence of his
illustrious nephew, the author of the <i>Plurality of Worlds</i>,
is situated in the <i>Rue des bans Enfans</i>, and is distinguished
in the same manner. The whole <i>Si&#233;cle de Louis XIV</i>,
scarcely contains two names upon which Voltaire dwells with more
pleasure.&#8212;Rouen was also the birth-place of the learned
Bochart, author of <i>Sacred Geography</i> and of the
<i>Hieroz&#246;icon</i>; <a name="Page_226" id=
"Page_226"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;226]</span></a>of
Basnage, who wrote the <i>History of the Bible</i>; of Sanadon, the
translator of Horace; of Pradon, "damn'd," in the Satires of
Boileau, "to everlasting fame;" of Du Moustier, to whom we are
indebted for the <i>Neustria Pia</i>; of Jouvenet, whom I have
already mentioned as one of the most distinguished painters of the
French school; and of Father Daniel, not less eminent as an
historian.&#8212;These, and many others, are gone; but the
reflection of their glory still plays upon the walls of the city,
which was bright, while they lived, with its lustre;&#8212;"nam
pr&#230;clara facies, magn&#230; diviti&#230;, ad hoc vis corporis,
alia hujuscemodi omnia, brevi dilabuntur; at ingenii egregia
facinora, sicuti anima, immortalia sunt. Postrem&#242; corporis et
fortun&#230; bonorum, ut initium, finis est; omnia orta occidunt et
aucta senescunt: animus incorruptas, &#230;ternus, rector humani
generis, agit atque habet cuncta, neque ipse habetur."</p>
<p>The more remote and historical honors of Rouen would present
ample materials. Prior to the Roman invasion, it appears to have
been of less note than as the capital of Neustria.</p>
<p>Julius C&#230;sar, copious as he is in all that relates to Gaul,
makes no mention of Rouen in his Commentaries. Ptolemy first speaks
of it as the capital of the Velocasses, or Bellocasses, the people
of the present Vexin; but he does not allow his readers to
entertain an elevated idea of its consequence; for he immediately
adds, that the inhabitants of the Pays de Caux were, singly, equal
to the Velocasses and Veromandui together; and that the united
forces of the two latter tribes did not amount to one-tenth part of
those which were kept on foot <a name="Page_227" id=
"Page_227"><span class="pagenum">[Page&#160;227]</span></a>by the
Bellovaci.&#8212;Not long after, however, when the Romans became
undisputed masters of Gaul, we find Rouen the capital of the
province, called the <i>Secunda Lugdunensis</i>; and from that tine
forward, it continued to increase in importance. Etymologists have
been amused and puzzled by "Rothomagus," its classical name. In an
uncritical age, it was contended that the name afforded good proof
of the city having been founded by Magus, son of Samothes,
contemporary of Nimrod. Others, with equal diligence, sought the
root of Rothomagus in the name of Roth, who is said to have been
its tutelary god; and the ancient clergy adopted the tradition, in
the hymn, which forms a part of the service appointed for the feast
of St. Mellonus,&#8212;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Extirpate Roth idolo,</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Fides est in lumine;</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Ferro cinctus, pane solo</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Pascitur et flumine,</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Post h&#230;c junctus est in polo</p>
<p class="i1">&#160;Cum sanctorum agmine."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The partizans of <i>Roth</i> are therefore supported by the
authority of the church; the favorers of <i>Magus</i> must defend
themselves by more worldly erudition; and we must leave the task of
deciding between the claims of the two sections of the word,
divided as they are by the neutral <i>o</i>, to wiser heads than
ours.</p>

April 1815, it was bought by the present Duke of Marlborough for
six hundred and eighty-seven pounds fifteen shillings.&#8212;The
following anecdote, connected with it, was communicated to me by a
literary friend, who had it from one of the parties interested; and
I take this opportunity of inserting it, as worthy of a place in
some future <i>Bibliographical Decameron</i>.&#8212;At the time
when the Bedford Missal was on sale, with the rest of the Duchess
of Portland's collection, the late King sent for his bookseller,
and expressed his intention to become the purchaser. The bookseller
ventured to submit to his Majesty, that the article in question, as
one highly curious, was likely to fetch a high price.&#8212;"How
high?"&#8212;"Probably, two hundred guineas!"&#8212;"Two hundred
guineas for a Missal!" exclaimed the Queen, who was present, and
lifted up her hands with extreme astonishment.&#8212;"Well, well,"
said his Majesty, "I'll still have it; but, since the Queen thinks
two hundred guineas so enormous a sum for a Missal, I'll go no
farther."&#8212;The bidding for the royal library did actually stop
at that point; and Mr. Edwwards carried off the prize by adding
three pounds more.</p>

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
